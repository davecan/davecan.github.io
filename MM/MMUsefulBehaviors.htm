<a name="selfmonitoring"></a>
<h2><a name="zzee_link_1_1418747146">Self-monitoring</a></h2>

<p class='purpleprose'>
When you are doing math, watch yourself doing it.
</p>

 <p class=bluesmall>The idea is to install in your brain a  <b>Watcher</b> <img width=37 height=18
src="Mathematica/UsefulBehaviors/image001.jpg"> who watches what you do <i>without being judgmental.</i> <a href="//mathforum.org/mathed/">Math Ed</a> people call this <span class=red>self-monitoring.</span></p>


<p class=bluesmall>Self-monitoring enables you to discover <span class=red>what works and what doesn't work</span>. When you practice self-monitoring successfully while doing math, then in the long run you will learn more about doing math than you will with any other practice suggested on abstractmath.org.</p> 

<p class=smallind>Abstractmath.org describes mistakes other people make, and sometimes reading about them may help you. But when you watch yourself doing math, you are learning about what <i>you</i> do, not about what <i>other</i> people do.</p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4>

<p>Suppose you are told that your college has 6 times as many students as professors
and that the total number of students and professors is 1400.  How many students
does your college have?</p>

<p>You start working.  Let $s$ be the number of students
and $p$ be the number of professors.  So \[6s=p\text{  
and   }s+p=1400\]
Then $s+6s=1400$, so $7s=1400$, so $s=200$. So the
college has $200$ students. <span class=red>Panic!</span>  That can’t be right!  Let’s see, $6s=p$ and $s+p=1400$.  So plug $p=6s$ into $s+p=1400$ and you get $s+6s=1400$, so $7s=1400$ but <span class=red>that's the same thing I got before!</span></p>

<p> But now the <b>Watcher</b>
<img border=0 width=37 height=18 src="Mathematica/UsefulBehaviors/image001.jpg"> says: 
<font color="#101090"><b>You did the same thing twice and got the same answer.  Maybe it’s time to try something else.  Like for example checking what you did!</b></font></p>

<p>Well, $6s=p$ is right, that’s $6$ students for every professor. 
No wait a minute, "$6s=p$"  means that if there are $100$ students there are $600$ professors. <span class=red >Aargh. I got it backward. Rowrbazzle! I should have written $6p=s$…</span></p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>This
example is well-known to math ed people. The conceptual blunder is
thinking of <i>p </i>and <i>s </i>as <i>labels </i><i>instead of as </i><i>variables. 
</i>The math ed people call it the “student-professor problem”.  (Seems to
me every math misconception is a student-professor problem?)</li>

<li class=bluesmall>Self-monitoring
is a great help in other aspects of life besides math!  Typically, people do it
in certain types of activity and not in others (different for different
people). Sometimes people <i>avoid thinking about</i> or grappling
with problems that they have in certain areas of life, with the result that <i>they don’t solve their problems</i> in that area.</li>

</ul>

<a name="zoomchunk"></a>

<h2><a name="zzee_link_2_1418747146">Zooming and chunking</a></h2>

<p class=bluesmall><span class=red>Zooming and chunking</span> is a technique that almost anyone with practice at dealing with abstract math will use to analyze a problem.</p> 

<h4><a name=complicated>Example</a></h4>

<p>This example requires
only first year calculus. It is also discussed in <a href="/MM/MMFunctionRepresentations.htm#thisgraphcanfoolyou">Functions: Representations</a></p>

<p>Suppose your research has come up with the function \[f(x)=.0002{{\left( \frac{{{x}^{3}}-10}{3{{e}^{-x}}+1}
\right)}^{6}}\]

<p style='text-indent:0in'>defined for real numbers $x$. 
You want to understand how this function behaves.  If I were looking at it, I
would go through some process like this:</p>
<ul>
<li> Is $f(x)$ </i>defined everywhere? (Meaning, is the denominator <i>never
</i> $0$?)  Yes, ${{e}^{x}}$ is positive for all real numbers $x$, so $3{{e}^{-x}}+1$
has to be positive. </li>

<li> In fact, I just noticed that $3{{e}^{-x}}+1$ must always be greater
than $1$.  This means that $f(x)$ is always less than $.0002{{({{x}^{3}}-10)}^{6}}$.</li>

<li>$f(x)$ is a positive number times a $6$<sup>th</sup>
power, so it is always nonnegative.  </li>

<li>Could $f(x)$ be zero?  Yes, the numerator is zero when $x=\sqrt[3]{10}$,
and that is the only place.  (Every real number has exactly one real cube
root.)</li>

<li>When $x$ is positive, $3{{e}^{-x}}+1$ is extremely close to $1$, so
when you get very far out on the $x$ axis, $f(x)$ looks just like ${{({{x}^{3}}-10)}^{6}}$. 
This means it gets big very quickly as you go to the right.</li>

<li></i>…Well, big except near $\sqrt[3]{10}$
(about $2.1544$), where it has to be zero.  So it must dip down to $0$ shortly before it gets to $2.1544$
and that start going up again <i>very fast.</i></li>

<li><i>That means it has to have
a local minimum at $\sqrt[3]{10}$</i>.  Ye gods, I
don’t want to take that derivative… But I don't have to, I already know there is one local minimum and where it is.</li>

<li>What about negative $x$?  Well, there the denominator $3{{e}^{-x}}+1$ is very
large and grows a heck of a lot faster than any polynomial, so the graph to the
left of the $y$-axis ought to hug the $x$-axis (while staying just above
it).</li>

<li>…and so on.
</li></ul> 

<p>It is worth
taking a very close look at
what goes on in a mathematician’s head when they go through a process of
analysis like this. What happens with me is that I zoom in and out and when I have zoomed out I <b><i>see things in chunks:</i></b></p>



</table></center>
<center><table border="0"><tr><td>
<p class='purpleprose'>
I look at the <font size="4"><font color="#A31A1A">big picture</font></font><br />
Then zoom in on some <font size="2"><font color="#A31A1A">detail</font></font><br /> that tells me something about the graph<br /> then zoom out and look at the <font size="4"><font color="#A31A1A">big picture</font></font> again<br /> then zoom in on another <font size="2"><font color="#A31A1A">detail</font></font>...
</p></td></tr></table></center>

<p>Chunking is a kind of <b>psychological inverse to substitution</b>.  See this <a href="MMPatternRecognition.htm#sumofsquares">example</a>.</p>

<h3><i>In more detail</i></h3>

<p>In each step, <i>I
am selective in what details I pay attention to</i> and <i>lump the
stuff I am not paying attention to into “something”</i>, perhaps with a
qualification such as “something $\geq0$”.   The lumping part is called <a
href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)">chunking</a> or <a href="//homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/David.Tall/pdfs/dot1991h-gray-procept-pme.pdf">encapsulation</a>
in the math ed literature. (Computer science has a related idea of <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)">encapsulation</a>.)</p>

<p class="headed">1) <span class=bluesmall>Zoom out.</span>
$f(x)=.0002{{\left( \frac{\text{something}}{\text{something }&gt;0}
\right)}^{6}}$ so it is always defined.</p>

<p class="headed">2) <span class=bluesmall>Zoom in on numerator:</span>
$f(x)=.0002{{\left( \frac{{{x}^{3}}-10}{\text{something }&gt;1} \right)}^{6}}$
so $f(x)&lt;.0002{{\left( {{x}^{3}}-10 \right)}^{6}}$.</p>

<p class="headed">3)<span class=bluesmall> Zoom out further (ignoring the fact that what is between the parentheses is a fraction):</span>
$f(x)=.0002{{\left( \text{something} \right)}^{6}}$, which is $.0002{{\left(
\text{something else} \right)}^{2}}$, so it is always nonnegative.</p>

<p class="headed">4) <span class=bluesmall>Remember a math fact.</span>  Every real number has exactly one cube root, so ${{x}^{3}}-10=0$ when $x=\sqrt[3]{10}$</i> and nowhere else. </p>
<p class="headed">5) <span class=bluesmall>Blur out the denominator, keep everything else exact.</span> Since \[f(x)=.0002{{\left(
\frac{{{x}^{3}}-10}{\text{something nonzero}} \right)}^{6}}\] and the only time a fraction is zero when its numerator is zero, $x=\sqrt[3]{10}$ is the <i>only</i> $x$ for which $f(x)=0$.  </p>

<p>And so on…</p>

<h3>People are different from each other</h3>

<p><i>Not every mathematician would do this in exactly the
way I did.</i></p>

<ul>
<li>Many
would have lumped steps (1) and (2) into one step, noticing right away that the
denominator was not only positive but greater than 1.  I wrote the steps the
way I did because that was in fact the order in which I noticed things.  </li>

<li>I could
have referred to .0002 repeatedly as “something positive”.  In fact when I was
going through the process I always thought of it as .0002, so I wrote it that
way.  You might do it differently.</li>

<li>In step (3) I referred to the fact that ${{\left(
\text{something} \right)}^{6}}={{\left( \text{something else} \right)}^{2}}$. 
I could have noticed that the particular expression \[\text{something else }=\text{ }{{\left(
\text{something} \right)}^{3}}\] but <i>that is irrelevant</i>. <i>I
did not try to remember more detail than I had to.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>I have described a
way of understanding something complicated by focusing on one detail and
lumping all the other stuff into “something”, or “something with some property”.  This is the <b>zoom and chunk</b> method.  </p>

<h3>The

<h3>The
graph tells less than you think</h3>

<p>Tthe graph does not show you some aspects of the graph that the analysis above does show. You can’t tell just from looking at the graph that the function is asymptotic to $0$ in the negative direction and increases rapidly to the right of $\sqrt[3]{10}$</i>.  (It appears to do these things but you could be fooled.)  You can’t tell it is zero only at one place, either.</p>

<h2><a name="zzee_link_3_1418747146">Rewrite according
to the definitions</a></a></h2>

<p class=bluesmall>Every <a href="MMDefs.htm">definition</a> provides a <b>method of proof:</b></p>

</table></center>
<center><table border="0"><tr><td>
<p class='purpleprose'>
METHOD: To prove
that a statement<br />involving some concepts is true,<br />start by
<span class=red>rewriting the statement<br />using the definitions of the concepts</span>.
</p></td></tr></table></center>

<h3 class=redit>Example definition</h3>

<p><b>Definition</b>:
For any <a
href="MMNumbers.htm#integer">integer</a>
n: </p>
<ul>
<li>$n$ is positive if $n\gt0$. </li>

<li>$n$ is negative if $n\lt0$. </li>

<li>$n$ is nonnegative if $n\ge0$.</li>
</ul>

<p>This definition gives a <b><i>precise meaning</i></b> to the
words <b>positive</b>, <b>negative</b> and <b>nonnegative</b>. Any
question about whether a given integer is positive or negative must be
answered by <i>checking this definition. </i></p>

<h3>A theorem based on the definition</h3>

<h4>Theorem</h4>

<p>$0$ is nonnegative.</p>

<h4>Proof</h4>

<p>The definition of “nonnegative” says $n$ is nonnegative
if $n\ge 0$.  So to prove $0$ is nonnegative, we must show that $0\ge 0$.  But
that is true because $0=0$.</p>

<p>Similarly, the statement “0 is positive” is false
because  “$0\gt0$” is false.</p>


<p class=blue>When you are starting to learn about a part of abstract
math, the method of rewriting what you want to prove using the definitions is <i>the first thing you should do</i> when faced with a statement to be proved.  In most cases, that will not be enough to give the proof!  But it is a <i>start</i>, and it may suggest what to do next.</p>

<a name="babyexample"></a>
<h3>Baby examples</h3>



<p>The proof above that $0$ is nonnegative is a <b>baby example</b>. Abstractmath.org uses baby examples a lot. Their value is that you can concentrate on what is being illustrated without getting stuck in unfamiliar math.  Some students sneer at baby examples.  “I already knew that!”  <span class=purple>But the example above does not exist to teach you something about $0$.</span> It exists to teach you how, when you come across a definition new to you, <span class=purple>you use examples to understand it</span>.</p>

<p class=smallind>There are many different kinds of examples in math, discussed in <a
href="//www.cwru.edu/artsci/math/wells/pub/pdf/mathrite.pdf">Varieties of Mathematical Prose</a>, section 2.3.1.</p>

<h3>Other examples of proof by rewriting</h3>

<ul>

<li>The proof in the abmath section about the <a href="MMFormsProof.htm#directmethod">direct method</a> is a less babyish example of rewriting by definition.</li>

<li>Another one is the <a href="MMProofPresentation.htm#detailedproof">detailed proof</a> in the chapter on presentation of proofs. </li> 

<li>Notice how often the definition of “divides” is used in these examples. That is typical of proofs in the beginning of a subject.</li>

<li>More advanced proofs will typically not refer to the definitions much but instead draw on many theorems that have already been proved.</li>

</ul>

<a name="warning"></a>
<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>Whether they use rewrite by definition (at least in their heads) or not is a <i>sharp dividing line</i> between newbies to abstract math and those with even some successful experiences with it. Those with more experience do it <i>automatically
</i>and even <i>unconsciously</i>, and some of those who read the description I give here will react like:</p>

<p><font color="#B31B1B"><b>But that’s trivial!!  Why did you devote so much space to that??  It’s OBVIOUS.</b></font></p>
<p>See <a href="MMOtherAspectsUnderstanding.htm#ratcheteffect">ratchet effect</a>.</p>

<a name=pythtrig>
<p>Suppose you have a right triangle with legs $a$ and $b$ and hypoteneuse $c$.  The <a
href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem">Pythagorean Theorem</a> says that</p>

\[{{a}^{2}}+{{b}^{2}}={{c}^{2}}\]
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p><i>Derive the trig identit</i>y</p>

\[{{\sin

<p><i>from the Pythagorean Theorem</i>.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>This is what you are given: \[{{a}^{2}}+{{b}^{2}}={{c}^{2}}\] 
<p><b>Look ahead</b> to what you want to <i>prove: </i> ${{\sin

<p>By using the definition of sine and cosone, this means you want
to prove</p>
\[\frac{{{a}^{2}}}{{{c}^{2}}}+\frac{{{b}^{2}}}{{{c}^{2}}}=1\]</p>

<p>You can do that this way:  Take the given equation \[{{a}^{2}}+{{b}^{2}}={{c}^{2}}\]
and divide through by ${{c}^{2}}$, getting </p>

\[\frac{{{a}^{2}}}{{{c}^{2}}}+\frac{{{b}^{2}}}{{{c}^{2}}}=\frac{{{c}^{2}}}{{{c}^{2}}}\]

<p>But if $c\neq0$, then $\frac{{{c}^{2}}}{{{c}^{2}}}=1$,

<p class='purpleprose'>
When you learn about a new concept<br /> START THINKING OF EXAMPLES
</p></td></tr></table></center>


<h4 class=redit>Example</h4>

<p>Suppose you just learned the definition of <b>prime number</b>:</p>
<h4>Definition</h4>


<p>A positive integer $n\gt 1$ is prime if its only positive divisors are $1$ and $n$. (See <a href="MMDefs.htm#primedef">definition of prime</a>.)</p>

<p>You might have thoughts like this go through your head:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1$ is not a prime because it is not greater than $1$</li>

<li>$2$ is prime</li>

<li>$3$ is prime</li>
<li>$4$ is not a prime because $2$ is a divisor</li>



<li>$5$ is prime</li>

<li>$6$ is not prime because $2$ and $3$ are divisors.</li>
<li>$7$ is prime</li>
<li>$8$ is not prime because $2$ is a divisor…</p></li>


<li>Hold on!  If $n$ is
prime it has to be odd, because otherwise $2$ is a divisor!  Wait: $2$ is a prime anyway even if it is even.  So <i>the only even prime is $2$.</i> <font color="#B31B1B">(You have now discovered your first theorem.)</font></li>

<li>So if $n$ is odd it must be prime, because it is not divisible by $2$. <font color="#B31B1B">(You just discovered what you think is a theorem.)</font>... Hold on!  It might be divisible by <i>something else.  </i> That’s right, $9$ is odd but it is not a prime! <font color="#B31B1B">(You just disproved what you thought was a theorem.)</font></li>

<li>And so on…</li>
</ul>
<p>It is <i>vital</i> to generate example of any new concept (if you can!) because <b><i>that is the fastest road to understanding the concept.</i></b> See <a
href="//www.maa.org/t_and_l/sampler/rs_5.html">[Selden &amp;

<a name="trialanderror"></a>


<h2>Trial and error</a></h2>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4>
<p><a name=aatrial></a>Suppose
you need to know the largest integer <i>n</i> for which $n!\lt109$.  One way to do it is to
calculate: $4! = 24$, $5! = 120$, so the answer is $n=4$.   When I gave a problem that came down to this calculation in my discrete math class, most students solved it correctly, but several wrote apologies on their paper for doing it by trial and error.  Apologies are not necessary!</p>


</table></center>
<center><table border="0"><tr><td>
<p class='purpleprose'>
Trial and error is a valid method for doing math.

<p>In the case of this problem it is probably the easiest way to do it.   Even if you need to know the largest integer for
which $n\lt 70,000,000$ it makes sense to do it using trial and error with a calculator or a program such as Mathematica or Maple. </p>

<p>You don't have to start at $5!$ and work your way up. </p>

<ul>
<li>Take a wild guess: $20!=2,432,902,008,176,640,000$. Way too big.</li>

<li>Cut your guess into half: $10! =3,628,800$.  Way too small.</li>

<li>Split the difference: $15!=1,307,674,368,000$. Getting closer.
</li>

<li>Try $12!=479,001,600$. Nope, go down again.</li>

<li>$11!=39,916,800$.  Got it!</li>

<h2>Guessing</h2>
<p><b>Guessing</b> at the answer to a problem and then using a theorem to prove it is correct is legitimate.  Some students don't believe this!</p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4>

<p>You need to find $\int{\sin x \cos x\,dx}$.  You vaguely remember that it was $\sin^2 x$. But that is not a proof.  So you differentiate $\sin^2 x$ using the chain rule and you get $2\sin x\cos x$. Oops. That's twice what it should be.  So the answer must be $\frac{1}{2}\sin^2 x$.  Check again <span class=purple>(<i>always</i> check again!)</span>. The derivative of $\frac{1}{2}\sin^2 x$ is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 2\cdot \sin x\cos x$ which is $\sin x\cos x$.  The <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus">fundamental theorem of calculus</a> tells you that $\frac{1}{2}\sin^2 x$ must be the correct answer.</p>

respectable way to do math.</b> </p></font>

<p class='purpleprose'>
It is good math behavior<br />
to guess at an answer and then prove it is correct.

<p>You need not use a
specific method (for example substitution or integration by parts) to get an
integral.  <b><i>Any way of coming
up with the answer is OK as long as you can check it out </i></b>(in this case by using differentiation).


<p class=smallind>A teacher might <b><i>insist </i></b>that
you solve an integral problem by using substitution.  Of course, if
you practice doing five integrals by substitution you will get better at
it.  That didn’t stop me from being irritated by such practices when
I was a student.
