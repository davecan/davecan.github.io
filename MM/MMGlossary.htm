<p  class=blue>This Glossary is an alphabetized
list of words and phrases used in Mathematical English.  It includes several
kinds of entries:</p>

<ul>
<li class=blue> Technical
words in math that have two or more widely-used definitions.</li>

<li class=blue> Technical
words that suffer from <a href="MMCognitiveDissonance.htm#semanticcontamination">semantic
contamination</a>.</li>

<li class=blue>Words
such as <a href="#if">if</a>, <a href="#and">and</a>,
and <a href="#all">all</a> that are used to communicate the logical structure
of math arguments. These are also discussed on the <a
href="MMMathReasoning.htm">math reasoning</a> page, but all are cross
referenced.  </li></ul>

<p class=blue><i>Most technical words in math are not included.  The best sources for technical

<h1>A</h1>
 <a name="a"></a>
 <a name=indefinitearticle></a>
 <a name="indefinitedescription"></a>
<h2>a, an</h2>

<p>The word "a" or
"an" is the <b>indefinite article</b>, one of two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_(grammar)">articles</a> in English. </p>

<p class='smallind' >
The <b>articles</b> in English are the <b>indefinite article </b>"a" (with variant "an") and the <b>definite article</b>
"the". If your native language is not English you may have problems under&shy;standing mathe&shy;matical dis&shy;course because the articles are used in mathe&shy;matical English in some fairly subtle ways.</p>

<h4>Generic use</h4>

<p>In math writing, the indefinite
article may be used with the name of a type of <a href="MMMathObj.htm">math object</a> to produce
an <a name=indefinitedescription><b>indefinite des&shy;cription</b></a> – a
des&shy;crip&shy;tion that indicates an <a href="#arbitrary">arbitrary</a> or unspecified object of that type. (If you use "the", you get a <i>definite</i> descrip&shy;tion that refers to an instance of the object that has been
previously referred to.) </p>

<p class='purpleprose'>
When an indefinite description occurs<br /> in the <span class=red>subject</span> of a clause in math English,<br /> it usually must be read as referring to<br /> <span class=red>every object that fits that description</span>.</p>

<a name=genererr></a>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4>
<p>"Show
that an integer that is divisible by four is divisible by two."</p>
<ul>
<li>Correct interpretation: Show that <i>every integer that is divisible by four is divisible by two.</i></li>

<li>Incorrect
interpretation: Show
that <i>some integer that is divisible by four is divisible by two.</i> </li>
</ul>

<p>So in a sentence like this the
indefinite article has the force of a <a href="MMUnivTrue.htm">universal quanti&shy;fier</a>. More examples are given in the entries on <a href="MMUnivTrue.htm#forallsymbol">universal quanti&shy;fier</a> and <a href="/MM/MMConditional.htm#terminology">conditional assertions.</a>
</p>


<h4 class=redit>More examples</h4>



<ul><li>"A number divisible
by $4$ is even." (<i>Subject</i> of sentence.) This means that <i>any</i> number divisible
by $4$ is even.</li>

<li>"Show that a number
divisible by $4$ is even." (<i>Subject</i> of subordinate clause.) Again, it means <i>any</i> number. </li>

<li>"Problem: Find a number
divisible by $4$." (<i>Object</i> of verb.) This does not mean find every number divisible by $4$; one will do. </li></ul>

<h4>Difference with ordinary English</h4>

<p>In ordinary English sentences,
such as a "A wolf takes a mate for
life." the meaning is that the assertion
is true for a <i>typical</i> individual (typical wolf in this case). In math, however, the
assertion is required to be <i>true without exception.</i>  </p>

<h2>abstract algebra</h2>

<p>See<a href="#algebra"> algebra</a>. </p>

<h2><a name="abuse_of_notation"></a>abuse of notation</h2>

<p>Notation may be called <b>abuse of
notation</b> if it involves </p>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="MMMoreLanguage.htm#suppressionofparameters">suppression
of parameters</a> </li>

<li>
 <a href="MMMoreLanguage.htm#synecdoche">synecdoche </a></li>

<li>
 <a href="#identify">identifying</a> two
<a href="MMMathStructure.htm">structures</a> along an isomorphism between them.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Click on those entries for examples.</p>

<p class=smallind>The word "abuse" makes it
sound worse than it really is. <i> Without judicious use of this technique much
mathematical writing would be unreadable</i>.</p>



<h2><a name=aleph></a><a href="MMAlphabets.htm#aleph">aleph</a></h2>


<h2><a name="_algebra"></a><a name=algebra></a>algebra</h2>

<p>This word has many different meanings in the school system
of the USA, and college math majors in particular may be confused by the
differences. </p>


<p class='purpleprose'>
High school and college math are changing rapidly,<br /> so these descriptions are not dependable.
</p>


<ul>
<li><a name="high_school_algebra"><b>High school algebra</b></a>
is primarily algorithmic and concrete in nature.  This is where you learn to
solve <b>linear </b>and <b><a

them using word problems.</li>

<li><a name="college_algebra"><b>College algebra</b></a> is the
name given to a college course, perhaps remedial, covering the material covered
in high school algebra. </li>

<li><a name="linear_algebra"><b>Linear algebra</b></a> may be a

href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_theory">Wik</a>) or a course in
linear transformations in a more abstract setting. </li>


<li>
<a name="abstract_algebra">
A college course for math majors called <b>algebra</b>, <b>abstract

href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_theory">Wik</a>). It is for many
students the first course in abstract mathematics and may play the role of a
filter course. In some departments, linear algebra plays the role of the first
course in abstraction.</li>

<li>
<b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_algebra">Universal algebra</a></b>
is a subject math majors don't usually see except possibly in graduate school.
It is the general theory of <a href="MMMathStructure.htm">structures</a> with <a

operations</a> subject to equations, and is quite different in
character from abstract algebra.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name=algorithm></a>algorithm</h2>

<p>The word <b>algorithm</b> is used in three confusingly
similar ways:</p>

<h4>algorithm as process</h4>

<p>Mathematicians typically use the word "algorithm" for a step
by step <a name=process>process</a>
for calculating something, as for example the procedure expressed
roughly by the description <b><a href="#NM">(NM)</a> </b>below<b>.</b> <a
name="_Related_meanings_of_"algorithm""></a><a name=algprog></a> People who use
the word "algorithm" in this way may refer to a program implementing it as the <b>code
for the algorithm</b>.</p>

<h4>algorithm as program</h4>

<p>A program may itself be called "an algorithm". <a
name=algobj></a> In my experience, this is not common usage.</p>

<h4>algorithm as mathematical object</h4>

<p>In computer science or logic texts, the word "algorithm" may
be given a <a href="MMDefs.htm">mathematical definition</a> (for example
as a Turing machine (<a
href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TuringMachine.html">MW</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Wik</a>)),
turning an algorithm into a <a href="MMMathObj.htm">mathematical object.</a> </p>

<a name=swap></a>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><p>You can write a
program in Python and another one in C to take a list $a:=(a_1,\,a_2,\,a_3,\,a_4\,\ldots)$ with at
least three entries and swap the second and third entries. There is a sense in
which the two programs, although different as programs, <i>implement the "same"
algorithm (process)</i>: Change $(a_1,\,a_2,\,a_3,\,a_4\,\ldots)$ to $(a_1,\,a_3,\,a_2,\,a_4\,\ldots)$.
</p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><p><a name=newton></a>Newton’s Method gives rise to an algorithm in the sense of a
process.</p>
<p><a name=NM>(NM)</a> Start with a guess $x$ and let  $x:=x-f(x)/f'(x)$
(see <a href="MMOtherSymbols.htm#colonequals">colon-equals</a>) repeatedly until either </p>

<ul>
<li>
 $f(x)$
gets sufficiently close to 0, in which case $x$ is the answer, or</li>

<li>
 $f'(x)=0$,
or </li>

<li>
  the
process has gone on too long. </li>

</ul>

<p>This algorithm is not hard to implement in C, Pascal,
Python or many other programming languages.  But in all these cases you have
to get the syntax exactly right and take care of a lot of details such as
assigning labels to certain lines of the program. Note that (NM) is
not any of those programs:  it is <i>the process carried out by those programs</i>. </p>

<p>Algorithms are discussed in <a href="MMImagesMetaphorsFunctions.htm#algorithm">Functions: images and metaphors</a> and in detail in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p class='smallind' >
For many choices of starting point, Newton's algorithm will run forever and not give an answer.  (In practice it would probably result in some kind of overflow and stop with an error message.)  For many authors, "algorithm" means it always stops in a finite number of steps.  For them, Newton's process is not an algorithm.  There is a problem with their attitude: Determining whether a process is an algorithm is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_problem">undecidable problem</a>.</p>


<h2><a name=alias></a>alias</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry">symmetry</a> of the
square illustrated by the figure below can be described in two different ways. </p>

<p> </p>

<p><img width=339 height=114
src="Mathematica/Glossary/Symmetry1.gif"></p>

<ul>
<li>
 The corners
of the square are <b>relabeled</b>, so that what was labeled $B$ is now labeled $A$. This
is called the <b>alias interpretation</b> of the symmetry.  You are thinking of
moving the <i>labels</i> around. "Honestly, officer, I am Albert Aardvark, not Bubba
Bullfrog."</li>

<li>
 The
square is <b>moved</b> (turned), so that the corner labeled $A$ is now in the upper right
instead of the upper left. This is the <a name=alibi><b>alibi </b></a><b>interpretation</b>
of the symmetry.   You are thinking of moving the <i>square together with
its labels</i>. "Honestly,
officer, I was in Portland, Maine, not Portland, Oregon."</li>
</ul>


<p class='purpleprose'>
"Alibi" and "alias" are not mathematical properties of
transformations;<br /> they are <a href="MMImagesMetaphors.htm">ways to think
about them. 
</p>

<a name="all"></a>
<h2>all</h2>

<p>See <a href="MMUnivTrue.htm#all">universally true</a> and <a
href="MMConditional.htm#universal">universal conditional</a>.<p>


<a name="always"></a>
<h2>always</h2>


<p>The statement  "$x^2+1$ is <b>always</b> positive" (for a real variable $x$) is equivalent to the <a href="MMUnivTrue.htm">universally true statement</a>, "For every real number $x$, $x^2+1$ is positive" (strictly greater than $0$.)
</p>

<p>This use of "always" is noticeably less formal than other ways of expression universal statements.  The mental image behind it is that you can vary $x$ all over the place as long as you want and the expression stays greater than $0$.</p>


<h2><a name=ambient></a>ambient</h2>

<p>The word <b>ambient</b> is used to
refer to a <a
href="MMMathObj.htm">mathematical object,</a> such
as a space, that contains a given mathematical object. It is also commonly used
to refer to an operation on the ambient space. </p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><p>"Let $A$ and $B$ be subspaces of a space $S$ and
suppose $\phi$ is an ambient homeomorphism taking $A$
to $B$."  The point of this sentence is that $A$ and $B$ are not
merely homeomorphic, but they are homeomorphic via the automorphism $\phi:S\to S$ of the space
$S$. </p>

<h2><a name=and></a><a href="MMAndOrNot.htm#and">and</a></h2>


<h2><a href="MMUnivTrue.htm#any">any</a></h2>

<h2><a name=arbitrary></a><a name="_Arbitrary"></a>arbitrary</h2>

<p>Used to emphasize that there is no restriction
on the mathematical structure referred to by the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_phrase">noun phrase</a><b> </b>that
follows. In most cases the word adds no additional mathematical
meaning to the statement. You may usually use "any" in this situation instead of
"arbitrary".</p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4>


<p> "The
equation ${{x}^{r}}{{x}^{s}}={{x}^{r+s}}$ holds in an <b>arbitrary</b> <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_%28mathematics%29">group</a> (or "in <b>any</b> group"), but the
equation ${{x}^{r}}{{y}^{r}}={{(xy)}^{r}}$ requires commutativity."</p>

<p>In a phrase such as "Let S be an arbitrary set" the word <b>arbitrary</b>
typically signals an expectation of an upcoming proof by <a
href="MMUnivTrue.htm#_Toc133139542">universal generalization</a>.</p>


<h4>Consciousness raising about "arbitrary"</h4>

<p>People new to abstract math may have a systematic tendency
to underestimate how arbitrary a <a href="MMMathObj.htm">math object</a> can
be.  For example, the set $\{3,\,\,\pi ,\,\,\mathbb{R},\,\text{ the cosine
function}\}$ is a perfectly good set.  It is arbitrary, and, I admit, weird,
but it is a set.  Other examples:</p>

<p>More arbitrary <a href="MMSetNotation.htm#arbitrarysets">sets.</a></p>

<p>The function in the <a href="MMFuncExamples.htm#finite">Examples of Functions section</a> called <a href="MMFuncExamples.htm#finite">
a finite function</a> is an arbitrary function.</p>


<h2><a name=argument>argument</a></h2>

<p>This word has three
common meanings in mathematical discourse.</p>

<ul>
<li>
 The
angle a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number#Absolute_value_and_argument">complex number</a> makes with the real axis
is called the <b>argument</b> of the number. </li>

<li>
 The<a
href="MMFunctions.htm#input"> input</a> to a <a
href="MMFunctions.htm">function</a> may be called the <b>argument.</b> </li>

<li>
 A
<a href="MMProofs.htm">proof</a> may be called
an<b> argument</b>. </li>
</ul>

<p><span class=purple>This word can cause<a href="MMCognitiveDissonance.htm"> cognitive
dissonance</a>.</span> 
In English,"argument" can mean either: </p>

<ul>
<li>
 <b>Organized
step by step reasoning to support a claim</b>, as in,"The judge’s argument for
finding the suspect innocent was based on the fourteenth amendment."</li>

<li>
 <b>The
verbal expression of a disagreement</b>, as in "George and Martha had an
argument about the Venetian blinds."</li></ul>

<p>The meaning of disagreement is the common one and it may
carry a connotation of unpleasantness.  The three meanings in math that are
given above have no connotation of unpleasantness.</p>

<h2><a name=assertion>assertion</a></h2>

<p>An <b>assertion</b> in a mathematical text is a statement 
in math English (more <a href="MMMathEnglish.htm#assertion">here</a>) or the
symbolic language (see <a href="MMSymLang.htm#symbolicassertion">symbolic
assertion</a>).  The author’s intention in writing an assertion may be difficult
to determine (see <a href="MMIntent.htm">intent</a>).</p>

<h2><a name=assumption>assumption</a></h2>

<p>An <b>assumption</b> is an <a
href="MMMathEnglish.htm#assertion">assertion</a><b> </b>that is taken
as true in a given block of text that is its<a href="MMVarMeanings.htm#scope"> scope</a><a
name=scope></a>. "Taken as true" means that any proof in the scope of
the assumption may use the assumption to justify a claim without further argument.
</p>

<h4 class=redit>Examples</h4>
<ul>
<li>
 "Throughout
this chapter, G will denote an arbitrary Abelian group."  In that chapter,
a statement such as "The subgroup $B$ of $G$ is normal" can be taken
to be true without further justification because every subgroup of an Abelian
group is normal.</li>

<li>
 A
statement about a physical situation may be called an assumption.  Such a
statement is then taken as true for the purposes of constructing a <a
href="MMRepsModels.htm">mathematical model</a>. </li>

<li>
 The
hypothesis of a <a href="MMConditional.htm">conditional
assertion</a> stands as an assumption during the statement of the
assertion, and also through the proof if the proof is by <a
href="MMConditional.htm#modusponens">modus ponens</a>.  </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name=atleast>at least</a>, <a name=atmost>at most</a></h2>

<p>For real numbers  $x$ and  $y$ the
phrase"$x$ is <b>at least</b> $y$" means $x\ge y$.  The phrase
" $x$ is <b>at most</b> $y$" means $x\le y$. 

<h4 class=redit>Examples</h4>

<ul>
<li>The statement "$B$ has at least
one element" means exactly that $B$ is not <a href="MMSetSpecific.htm#emptyset">empty</a>.</li>

<li>The statement "$B$ has at most
one element" means $B$ is either the <a
href="MMSetSpecific.htm#emptyset">empty set</a> or a singleton set (a set with exactly one element).  (See also <a
href="MMPatternRecognition.htm#atmost">pattern recognition.</a>)</li>
<li>
The statement "$n$ is at least $2$  and $n$ is at most $2$ " means $n=2$.
</li> 
</ul>




<a  name=B>
<h1>B</h1>

<h2><a name=bar>bar</a></h2>

<p>A line drawn over a single symbol  is pronounced "<b>bar</b>".
For example, $\overline{x}$ is pronounced "$x$ bar".  It often refers to
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(mathematics)">closure</a> (in some sense) of a subset of a set.</p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><p>"Let $X$ be a topological
space with subset $Y$, and let $\overline{Y}$be the closure of $Y$ in
$X$." </p>

<p>Other names for this symbol are <b>macron</b>
and <b>vinculum</b>. </p>

<h2><a name=be>be</a></h2>

<p  style='text-indent:0in'>The verb "to be" with its inflected
forms "is" and "are" has many uses in the English language (see <a
href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/be">list in Wiktionary</a>). Here I mention
a few common usages in mathematical texts. </p>

<h4>To assert that an object is an example of a certain type of object</h4>

<p>For example,"Every integer <b>is</b> a rational number." 
</p>

<h4>Has a property</h4>

<p><a name=hasprop></a>
"Every integer <b>is</b> rational." This means the same thing as "Every integer is a rational number", but is expressed using different grammar. See <a href="MMMathObj.htm#properties">property</a>. 
</p>

<h4>To define a property</h4>

<p>In defining a property, the word "is"
may connect the <a href="MMDefs.htm#definiendum">definiendum</a> to the name of the property, as in: </p>

<p  align=center style='text-align:center'>"A group <b>is Abelian</b> if $xy=yx$ for all elements $x$
and $y$."</p>

<p  style='text-indent:0in'>Note that
this is not an <a
href="MMMathEnglish.htm#assertion">assertion</a>
that some group is Abelian, as in the previous entry; instead, it
is saying <i>what it means to be Abelian</i>.  It
is not always easy to know whether the author means such a statement as an
assertion or as a definition.  In this example the fact that the word "Abelian"
is in <a href="MMAlphabets.htm#bold">boldface</a> communicates that it is a
definition.  See <a href="MMDefs.htm">definitions</a> for more about this.</p>

<h4>To define a type of object</h4>

<p>In statements such as: </p>

<p>"A semigroup <b>is</b> a set with
an associative multiplication defined on<b> </b>it."</p>

<p  style='text-indent:0in'>the word "is"
connects a <a href="MMDefs.doc">definiendum</a> with the<b> condition </b>defining
it. Note again that it may not be clear whether this is an assertion or a
definition.  See <a href="MMDefs.htm">definitions</a> for other
examples. </p>

<h4>Is identical to</h4>

<p>The word "is" in the statement</p>

<p>"An idempotent function has the
property that its image <b>is </b>its set of fixed points."</p>

<p  style='text-indent:0in'>asserts
that two mathematical descriptions ("its image" and "its set of fixed points")
denote the same <a href="MMMathObj.htm">mathematical
object</a>. This is the same as the meaning of
" =". </p>

<h4>Asserting existence</h4>

<p>For example, "There is a number $x$ which is bigger than $2$ ".
See <a href="MMExistenceStatements.htm">existential quantifier</a> for other
ways this can be worded. </p>

<h2><a href="MMFuncExamples.htm#binaryoperation">binary operation</a></h2>

<h2><a name=bracket>bracket</a></h2>

<p>This word has several related
usages. </p>

<h4>Certain delimiters</h4>

<p><a name=delimb></a>In math texts,<b>
brackets</b> can mean any of the delimiters parentheses, square brackets,
braces, and angle brackets (see <a href="MMDelimiters.htm">delimiters</a>). Some American dictionaries and some
mathematicians restrict the meaning to square brackets or angle brackets</p>

<h4>Operation</h4>

<p class=MTDisplayEquation>The word
"bracket" is used in various mathematical specialties as the name of an operator (for example, Lie bracket, Toda bracket,
Poisson bracket) on an algebra. The operation called bracket may use square brackets,
braces or angle brackets to denote the operation. The Lie bracket of $v$ and $w$ is
always (as far as I know) denoted by $[v,w]$. On the other hand, notation for the Poisson and Toda brackets varies, with different authors using different symbols. 
</p>

<h4>Quantity</h4>

<p>The word "bracket" may
be used to denote the value of the expression inside a pair of
brackets (in the sense of delimiters).  For
example, </p>

<p>"If the expression 
\[\left(x^2-2x+1\right)+\left(e^{2x}-5\right)^3\]
is zero, then the two brackets are opposite in sign." This usage may be
obsolescent.</p>

<h2><a name=but>but</a></h2>

<h4>"and" with contrast</h4>

<p><a name=contrast></a>As a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_conjunction">conjunction</a>, <b>but</b> typically means the same as "<a href="MMAnd.htm">and</a>", with an
indication that what follows is surprising or in contrast to what precedes it.
This is a standard usage in English, not peculiar to <a href="MMMathEnglish.htm">mathematical
English</a>. </p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><p>
" 5 is odd, <b>but</b>  6 is even." </p>

<h4>introduces new property</h4>

authors may begin a sentence with "but" to indicate that the
subject under discussion has a relevant property that will now be mentioned.  For example, it may be relevant because it leads to the
next step in the reasoning. The property may be one that is easy to deduce or
one that has already been derived or assumed.</p>

<p>This usage may carry with it no
thought of contrast or surprise.  Of course,
in this usage "but" still means "and" as far as the logic goes; it is the connotations
that are different. </p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><p>"We have now shown that $m = pq$, where  $p$
and $q$ are primes. <b>But</b> that implies that $m$ is composite."
</p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><a name=nowuseok></a><p>(In a
situation where we already know that $x=7$): </p>

<p>"... We have now proved that ${{x}^{2}}+{{y}^{2}}=100$.
<b>But</b> $x$ is 7, so $y=\sqrt{51}$.</p>

<h2><a name=calculate>calculate</a></h2>

<p>To <b>calculate</b> may mean to perform <a
href="#symbolmanipulation">symbol manipulation</a> on an <a
href="MMSymLang.htm#symbolicexpression">expression</a>, usually with the intent
to arrive at another, perhaps more satisfactory,
expression. "<b>Compute</b>"
is used in much the same way. When mathematicians use one of these words, <span class=purple>neither word necessarily indicates that the
procedure was done on a computer or that a known <a
href="#algorithm">algorithm</a> was used.</span>  </p>

<h4 class=redit>Examples</h4>
<ul>
<li>

"An easy <b>calculation</b>
shows that the equation ${{x}^{3}}-5x=0$ factors into linear factors over the
reals."  The calculation would probably go like this: "${{x}^{3}}-5x=x({{x}^{2}}-5)$,
and we know that ${{x}^{2}}-5=(x-\sqrt{5})(x+\sqrt{5})$". "We know" is not
something that would occur in a program or algorithm!</li>

<li>

"Let us <b>compute</b> the roots
of the equation ${{x}^{2}}+3x-10=0$."  If you do this using the quadratic
formula then that really is a computation using an algorithm.  But you could
also try factoring $10=2\cdot 5$ and trying $(x-2)(x+5)$ and $(x+2)(x-5)$ – and
the first one works.  This is not an algorithm but many mathematicians would
still call it a computation or calculation.   (This remark about word usage is
not based on lexicographical research, but only my own observations.) </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name=call></a><a name=logiccalc></a>call</h2>

<p class=MTDisplayEquation><b>Call </b>may be used to form a <a href="MMDefs.htm">definition</a>. </p>

<h4 class=redit>Examples</h4>
<ul>
<li>
"A monoid is <b>called</b> a <a name=group>group</a> if
every element has an inverse."</li>

<li>
"Let $g=h^{-1}fh$. We <b>call</b> $g$ the <i>conjugate</i>
of $f$ by $h$." </li>

<li>

"We <b>call</b> an integer <i>even</i>
if it is divisible by  $2$ ." </li>

</ul>


<p class='headed'><phead>Note:</phead> Some object to using "call" with an adjective, as in the third example

<h2><a name=case></a>case</h2>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><p>The Roman alphabet, the <a
href="MMAlphabets.htm#greekalphabet">Greek alphabet</a>, and the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_alphabet">Cyrillic alphabet</a> have
two forms of letters, "capital" or <a name=uppercase><b>uppercase</b></a>, A,
B, C, etc, and <a name=lowercase><b>lowercase</b></a>, a, b, c, etc.   </p>


<p><i>Case distinction always matters in mathematics.</i> 
It is common for example to use a capital letter to name a <a href="MMMathStructure.htm">mathematical structure</a>
and the same letter in lowercase to name an element of the structure. This
means that when you take notes at a lecture in abstract math, you must write "$S$"
when the lecturer writes "$S$" and "$s$" when the lecturer writes "$s$"!</p>

<h2><a name=cases>cases</a></h2>
<p class=smallind>The word "cases" in this entry has no connection with the word "case" described in the preceding entry.</p>
<p>A concept is <a name="definition_by_cases"><b>defined by
cases</b></a> if it is dependent on a <a
href="MMParameters.htm">parameter</a> and the <a
href="MMFuncName.htm#definingexpression">defining expression</a> is different
for different values of the parameter. This is also called a <a
name="disjunctive_definition"><b>disjunctive definition</b></a> or <a
name="split_definition"><b>split definition</b></a>. </p>

<h5>Examples</h5>
<ul>

<li>The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value">absolute
value function</a> is defined by cases:\[|x|=\left\{ \begin{align}
  & x\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\text{(}x\geq0\text{)} \\
 & -x\,\,\,\,\,\,\text{(}x\lt 0\text{)} \\
\end{align} \right.\]</li>

<li>Let the function $f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ be defined by</p>
\[f(x)=\left\{ \begin{align}
  & x+1\,\,\,\,\,\,\text{(}x<2\text{)} \\
 & x-1\,\,\,\,\,\,\text{(}x\ge 2\text{)} \\
\end{align} \right.\] Then for example, $f(1.9) = 2.9$ and $f(2.01) =1.01$.  This defines <i>one</i> function $f$, although the expression $f(x)$ is calculated using two different formulas depending on whether $x\lt 2$ or not.</li>

<li>In many calculus books, the expression "$\sin^n$" means two different things depending on whether $n$ is $-1$ or some other integer.  Details <a href="MMVarMeanings.htm#arcsin">here</a>.</li>


<li>The word "<a href="MMGlossary.htm#if">if</a>" in math English means two different things depending on whether it is used in a definition or in a theorem.</li>
</ul>

<p>Disjunctive definitions may seem unnatural at first. This
may be because real life definitions are rarely disjunctive. One exception is
the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_zone">strike</a> in
baseball (swing and miss or didn’t swing when the ball was in the zone or one of several other possibilities).</p>

<h2>comma </h2>

<h4>And</h4>

<p>A comma between <a

denote <a href="#and">and</a>. </p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><p>The set $\{m|m={{n}^{2}},\,\,\,n\in

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><p>"Let $x,\,\,y\ne 0$." 
This means "Let $x\ne 0$ and $y\ne 0$", which means the same as "Let <b>each of</b> $x$ and $y$ be nonzero".</p>

<h2><a name=degenerate>degenerate</a></h2>

<p>The word<b> degenerate</b> is used in some disciplines to
describe a particular math structure with one or both of the following
properties:</p>

<p  style='margin-left:.1in;line-height:14.0pt'>a)  Some parts
of the structure that are normally distinct are the same in this particular
example.</p>

<p  style='margin-left:.1in;line-height:14.0pt'>b)  Some <a
href="MMParameters.htm">parameter</a> is 0.  (<a href="#trivial">Trivial</a>
is also sometimes used for this meaning.)</p>

<h4 class=redit>Examples</h4>
<ul>
<li>
 A
line segment is a <b>degenerate</b> isosceles triangle.  The two equal sides
coincide and the third side has length 0.  This fits both a) and b).</li>

<li>
 A
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_point_%28mathematics%29">critical
point</a> is <b>degenerate</b> if it satisfies a certain technical condition,
namely that the determinant of its <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_matrix">Hessian</a> is 0.  This fits
b).  A small perturbation turns a degenerate critical point into several
critical points, so this also "sort of" fits a).  </li>
</ul>

<p class='headed'><phead>Usage:</phead> The word <b>degenerate </b>is given a mathematical
definition in some fields and is used informally in others.  Many specialties
in math never use the word.  </p>

<p>More than
  half of the examples I turned up on <a href="http://www.jstor.org/">JSTOR</a>
  when doing research for the <a

  were refer&shy;ences to degen&shy;erate critical points.</p>


<h2><a name=denote>denote</a></h2>

<p>To say that an expression $E$ <b>denotes</b> a specific object $B$ means
that $E$ refers to $B$; in an assertion containing a description of $B$, the
description can be replaced by $E$ and the truth value of the assertion
remains the same. $B$ is sometimes called the <b>denotation</b> of $E$.</p>

<h4>Examples </h4>

<ul>
<li>"The symbol $\pi$ denotes the ratio of the circumference of a
circle to its diameter."</li>

<li>"Let $f$ denote the function $x\mapsto x^2:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$."</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Opinions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Some authors write sentences such as "Let $f$ denote any
continuous function".  "Denotes" is best restricted to referring to a <i>specific</i> object, so it is better to say, "Assume $f$ is any continuous function."   </li>

<li>Some authors write sentences such as "The
ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter is denoted $\pi$."  It is perhaps more transparent to say "denoted <i>by</i> $\pi$."</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name=description>description</a></h2>

<p>A <b>description</b> (in mathematical English and in the symbolic language) is a noun or noun phrase that refers to a particular object (a <a href="/MM/MMGlossary.htm#the">definite description</a>) or an unspecified object of a certain type (<a href="/MM/MMGlossary.htm#a">indefinite description</a>).</p>



<h2><a name=disjoint>disjoint</a></h2>

<p>Two sets $S$ and $T$ are <b>disjoint</b> if their <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_%28set_theory%29">intersection</a>
is empty, in other words if they have no elements in common.  A <i>family</i> of sets
is <a name=pairwisedisjoint><b>pairwise disjoint</b></a> if any two different sets in the family are disjoint.  
</p>

<h4 class=redit>Examples</h4>
<ul>
<li>

${1,2}$ and ${3,4,5}$ are disjoint. </li>

<li>

Let ${{\mathbb{R}}^{+}}$ denote
the set of all <a href="#positive">positive</a> <a
href="MMRealNumbers.htm">real numbers</a> and ${{\mathbb{R}}^{-}}$ the
set of all negative real numbers.  Then ${{\mathbb{R}}^{+}}$and ${{\mathbb{R}}^{-}}$
are disjoint.  There is no real number that is both positive and negative.</li>

<li>

The set $\left\{ (n,n+1)|n\in
\mathbb{R} \right\}$ is  a pairwise disjoint family of subsets of the reals (here
$(n, n+1)$ denotes the <a href="MMSetSpecific.htm#interval">open interval</a> $\{x|\,n\lt x\lt n+1\}$,
not the ordered pair.)</li>

<li>

 A statement such as "Let $A$, $B$ and $C$ be disjoint sets"
usually means that the sets are pairwise disjoint.  When I was searching the
literature for the <a
href="http://abstractmath.org/Books/handbkhyper.pdf">Handbook</a>, I
could not find a clear example where such a statement meant that no element was
in every set; it always meant no element was in any two <i>different</i> sets.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Warning</h4>

<p>"Disjoint" requires two sets.  Don’t say things such as:
"Each set in a <a href="MMEquivalenceRelations.htm#partition">partition</a>
is disjoint".   You <i>could </i> say
"each set in a partition is disjoint from each of the other sets."</p>

<abbr></abbr>

<h2><a name=distinct>distinct</a></h2>

<p>When several new identifiers are introduced at once, the word <b>distinct</b> is used to
require that <i>no two different ones</i> can have the same value.</p>


<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><p>
"Let $m$ and $n$ be distinct integers."
This means that in the text that follows, one can assume that $m\neq n$.
</p>

<h4>Difficulties </h4>

<p>
Students may not understand that without a word such as "distinct", the variables
<i>may indeed have the same value</i>. Thus
"Let $m$ and $n$ be integers"
allows $m = n$.</p> 

<p class=smallind>It is reported that E. H. Moore was sufficiently bothered
by this phenomenon to say,
"Let $m$ be an integer and let $n$ be an integer."

<li>
 A
connected open set in a topological space.  </li>

<li>

<li>
 A

</ul>
<p class=smallind>I recall as a graduate student
being puzzled by the first two meanings given above, with the result that I
spent a (mercifully short) time trying to prove that the domain of a continuous
function had to be a connected open set. </p>


<a  name=E> <h1>E</h1>

<a name="ie"></a><a name="i.e."></a><a name="e.g."></a><a name="eg"></a>

<h2>e.g., i.e</h2>

<p>The expression "<b>e.g.</b>" means "for example". The expression "<b>i.e.</b>" means "that is".  These abbreviations  confuse
many readers and writers, including writers in the research literature. <i>They have are significantly different meanings. </i>

<h4 class=redit>Examples</h4>
<ul>
<li>
"Let $n$ be an even integer, e.g. $6$."   This means that in the next bunch of text, $n$ might be $6$ but it doesn't have to be. </li>

<li>
"Let $n$ be an even integer, i.e. $6$."   This is bad.  Taken literally, it suggests that $6$ is
the <i>only</i> even integer.</li>

<li>
"Let
$n$ be an even integer, e.g. divisible by $2$ ."  Bad.  It says,"Let n be an even integer,
for example divisible by $2$ ."  The reader expects the phrase after the comma to
provide a particular integer that is even, but it doesn’t.    </li>

<li>
"Let

<h2><a name=each>each </a></h2>

<p>The word <b>each </b>may generally be used in the sasme way
as <a href="MMUnivTrue.htm#all">all</a>, <a href="MMUnivTrue.htm#every">every</a>
and <a href="MMUnivTrue.htm#any">any</a> to form a <a
href="MMUnivTrue.htm#universalquantifier">universal quantifier</a>.  However it
is not common to see an assertion worded as "Each multiple of $4$ is even".  "Each" is more commonly used for a distributive plural.</p>

<h4 class=redit>Examples</h4>
<ul>
<li>
"For <b>each</b> even number $n$
there is an integer $k$ for which $n =2k$."
Different numbers $n$ get different $k$'s (that's what "distributive plural" means). "Every" could be used here as well.
</li>

<li>
"For <b>each</b> number $n$
there is an integer $k$ for which $n \lt k$."
For this example, in contrast to the preceding one, there are many $k$'s that work for each $n$.  However, there is no <i>one</i> number $k$ that works for <i>every</i> $n$.
</li>

<li>
"Each student has a pencil." In ordinary non-mathematical English, this means that each student has a <i>different</i> pencil from any other student, but it does not rule out that some students have more than one pencil.  This is different from the previous example, in which the <i>same</i> $k$ can work for <i>many</i> $n$'s.  Thus the mathematical usage of "each" is not the same as the ordinary English usage.</li>

<li>
 "Five students have two pencils <b>each</b>."  This means
that each of the five students has two pencils (a different two for each
student). This usage occurs in combinatorics, for example.  Some students do
not grasp the significance of a postposited "each" as in this sentence.s

<h2>factor</h2>

<p>A <b>factor</b> is a constituent of a <a href="MMGlossary.htm#multiplication">product</a>.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>



<li>A factor of an integer is a divisor of the integer. For example, $6$ is a factor of $12$, since $12=6\times2$.</li>

<li>You would not say $6$ is a factor of $9$, even though $9=6\times\frac{3}{2}$. There is a hidden <a href="http://abstractmath.org/MM/MMVarMeanings.htm#convention">convention</a> that for integers, a factor of an integer must occur in a product consisting only of integers -- no fractions allowed. </li>

<li>$x^2+1$ is a factor of the polynomial $(x^2+1)(x^2-1)$.</li>

<li>You could also say that $x^2+1$ is a factor of the polynomial $x^4-1$. In this case, the presence of $x^2+1$ is hidden, but the statement is still correct.</li>

<li>$8=3+5$, but $3$ is not a factor of $5$.  The word <b>factor</b> refers only to products.</li>

</ul>

<p class=smallind>The word "product" is used for many other math objects besides integers and polynomials, and there are conventions about the use of "factor" in those cases as well. I have not done any lexicographical research about these other situations, but I know enough examples to assert that the situation is quite complicated.  For example, a factor of a group $G$ does not have to occur in a product of groups that is isomorphic to $G$.</p>

topological semigroups".  This meaning occurs in all academic subjects.  "Field" is also discussed in the chapter on <a href="MMNames.htm#field">Names</a>.</p>


<a name=find>
<h2>find</h2>

<p>Used in problems in much the same way as <a
href="#producedescription">give.</a></p>

<a name=fix><h2>fix </h2>

<ul><li>
 A function $f$ <b>fixes </b>a point $p$ if
$f(p) = p$. This is based on this <a
href="MMImagesMetaphors.htm#metaphor">metaphor</a>:
you fix an object if you make it hold still (she fixed a poster to the wall). This metaphor may not be helpful to Americans; in my observation, in the USA, the word nearly always means "repair".</li>

<li>
"Fix"
is also used in sentences such as "In the following we fix a point $p$ one
unit from the origin", which means that we will be talking about any point one unit from the origin (a
variable point!) and we have established the notation $p$ to
refer to that point. The metaphor behind this usage is that the value is "fixed" throughout the discussion; every reference to $p$ is to the same value, even though the value is not specified.
</li>
</ul>


<h2>follow</h2>

<h4>Implies</h4>

<p>The statement that an assertion $Q$ <b>follows </b>from an
assertion $P$ means that $P$ implies $Q$ (if $P$,
then $Q$).</p>

<p class='headed'><phead>Example</phead><p>"The integer $n$  is divisible by 16.  It follows that
it is even."</p>

<h4>Grouping</h4>

<p>
The word "follow" is also used to indicate that
some statements after the current one are to be grouped with the current
one, or (as in "the following are equivalent)" are to be grouped with each
other.</p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><p>"A set $G$ with a binary operation is a <b>group
</b>if it satisfies the following axioms ... " This statement indicates
that the axioms that follow are part of the definition currently in progress.</p>

<a name="followingareequivalent"></a><a name="TFAE"></a>

<h2>following are equivalent </h2>

<p>The phrase "<b>the
following are equivalent" </b>(or <a name=TFAE>"<b>TFAE</b></a><b>")
</b>is used to assert the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if">equivalence</a> of the assertions that follow (presented in a list). </p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><p>
The following are equivalent:</p>
<ul>
<li>"$x\geq0$ and $x\leq0$."</li>
<li>"$x+1=1$".</li>
<li>"$x=0$."</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name=formula>formula</a></h2>


<ul>
<li>
 In
informal usage in math, a <b>formula</b> is an <i>expression</i> allowing you to
calculate some quantity.   More <a

<li>
 In
<a href="MMMathReasoning.htm#mathlogic">math logic</a>, a <a

an arrangement of symbols that represents a <i>statement</i>, possibly containing

language (<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FormalLanguage.html">MW</a>, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language">Wi</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>The equation $A=\pi {{r}^{2}}$ is a formula in both senses,
but $\pi {{r}^{2}}$("the formula for the area of a circle") is a formula only
in the first sense above.  In <a href="MMMathReasoning.htm#mathlogic">mathematical logic</a>, $\pi {{r}^{2}}$ would be
called a <b>term</b>.</p>

<h2><a href="MMFuncSpec.htm#functional">functional </a></h2>

<h2><a name=forwardreference>forward reference</a></h2>

<p>
In the sentence, "When it is the subject of a clause, an indefinite description has the force of universal quantification", the pronoun "it" refers to the phrase "indefinite description", which occurs <i>later</i> in the sentence.  This is called a <b>forward reference</b> (or "cataphoric reference").   Not only non-native English-speakers but many <i>native</i> English speakers do not automatically understand forward references.   That is why in the <a href="#indefinitearticle"> entry for indefinite article</a>,
I reworded that sentence.</p>

<p>
Another example: The question "Explain how to determine from the last digit of its octal notation whether an integer is even" baffled some of my discrete math students.
</p>

<p>Forward reference is a type of <a

<h2><a name=give>give</a></h2>

<p><b>Give</b> is used in several ways in math English. often with the same sense it would be used in any
academic text ("we give a proof... ","we give a construction ... "). </p>


<h4>Produce a <a name=producedescription>description</a> of an example</h4>

<p>To "<b>give</b> an <a
href="MMMathObj.htm">object</a>" means to describe it sufficiently that it is
uniquely determined. A phrase of the form "give an $X$ such that $P$"
means describe a object of type $X$ that
satisfies predicate $P$. The word <b>find</b> can be used in this meaning as well.</p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4>
<p>"Problem: Give (or find) a function of $x$ that is
positive at $x$ = 0." Correct answers to this problem could be
"the cosine function on the reals" or "the functions $f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ <b>given</b> by $f(x)= 2x + 1$."
</p>

<h4>"Given" can mean "if" or "let"</h4>



<p><b>$ $</b>"Given sets $S$ and $T$, the <b>intersection
</b> $S\cap T$ is the set of all
objects that are elements of both $S$ and $T$."</p>

<p>This means "If $S$ and $T$
are sets, the <b>intersection
</b> $S\cap T$ is the set of all
objects that are elements of both $S$ and $T$" or "Let $S$ and $T$ be sets.  Then the <b>intersection
</b> $S\cap T$ is$\ldots$"  </p>

<h2><a name=glue>glue</a></h2>

<p>To <b>glue </b>two math objects together is to <a

reversing the right edge of a rectangle and glueing it to the left edge, as
described <a
href="http://www.math.ohio-state.edu/~fiedorow/math655/unorientable.html">here.</a> 
This means you identify (in the mathematical sense) the reversed right edge
with the left edge.  This is a metaphor that is also a literal description of
what you do with a real rectangle made out of paper, too!</p>

<h2><a name=graph>graph</a></h2>

<p>The word <b>graph</b> has two

<ul><li>

The <a

<li>

A (directed or undirected) <b>graph</b> is a structure
consisting of nodes with directed or undirected edges that connect the nodes,
often subject to further conditions that are discussed in detail in the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">Wikipedia article</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In both cases, the word <b>graph</b> is
used both for the math object itself and also for a drawing of (often only part
of) the math object.</p>

<ul>
<li>
$\mathbf{I}$ (<a href="MMAlphabets.htm#bold">bold</a>) may denote the

</li>

<li>
$I$ (not usually bold) may be used as the name of an arbitrary index set.
</li>

<li>
For some authors, $\mathbf{I}$
or $\mathbb{I}$ (<a href="MMAlphabets.htm#blackboardbold">blackboard bold</a>) 
means the set of integers; however, $\mathbf{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}$ is also used for
this. </li>

$\mathbf{I}$ may denote the <a

</li>

<li>
$i$ (usually lowercase)
denotes one of the square roots of –1.  (The other one is then $-i$).  In
engineering, $ j$ is very frequently used instead of $i$ for this. 
</li>

</ul>
<p class=purple>These various meanings are quite
commonly used without explanation. </p>

<h2><a href=#i.e.>i.e.</a></a></h2>


<h2><a name=identify>identify</a> </h2>
 
<p>To <b>identify</b> a math
object $A$ with another object $B$ is to regard them as the
same object.  In particular each element or point in $A$ is regarded as the
same as a particular element or point in $B$.  In most cases, the author has in mind
a particular way of matching the points in $A$ and the points in $B$.  This
"particular way" may be presented informally or as a formal mathematical
construction.</p>

<p class='smallind' >
This is an informal or sug&shy;ges&shy;tive defi&shy;nition of "identify", not a math defi&shy;nition, because I haven't said what "ele&shy;ment or point in" means.
</p>

<h4>The real plane</h4>

<ul>
<li>
 You
may regard each point of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)">real plane</a> as having specific
coordinates, an ordered pair of real numbers.  Example: "Consider the point
with coordinates (2.3, -1.45)." </li>

<li>On the other hand, you may think of the
points of the real plane as <b>identified </b>with ordered pairs of real
numbers.  Example: "Consider the point (2.3, -1.45)."
</li></ul><p>
These are two different ways of
thinking about the plane -- as a set of points represented by ordered pairs, or as a set of ordered pairs.
This is an example of <a

</p>
<h4>Möbius strip</h4>


<p>
 The <a name=mobiusglue></a><a

constructed by <b>identifying</b> or <a href="#glue">gluing</a> the

\[\left\{

of the unit square with the edge
\[\left\{
(x,1)|\,0\le y\le 1 \right\}\] in
such a way that $(x, 0)$ is <b>identified with</b> $(1 – x,
1)$. This can be thought of as saying that the coordinates  $(x,
0)$ and $(1 – x, 1)$ refer to the same point.  This is an example of <b>identifying</b> objects by a
<i>formal mathematical construction</i>.</p>

<p class='headed'><phead>Usage:</phead> In ordinary English,
"identify" means to give a name to. This presumably could cause <a
href="MMCognitiveDissonance.htm">cognitive dissonance.</a></p>

<h2><a name=identity>identity </a></h2>

<p>This word has three common meanings.</p>

<a name="law"></a>

<h4>Equation that always holds</h4>

<p>An <b>identity </b>in this sense is an equation that holds
between two expres&shy;sions for any valid values of the variables in the
expressions. Thus, for real numbers (in fact for complex numbers), the
equation

 \[{{(x+1)}^{2}}={{x}^{2}}+2x+1\]
is an identity.  An identity in this sense may also be called a <b>law</b>.</p>
<p>Sometimes in the case of an identity
the symbol "$\equiv$" is used instead of the equals sign. </p>

<h4>Identity element of an algebraic structure</h4>

<p>If $x\Delta e=e\Delta
x=x$ for all elements $x$ in an algebraic structure with binary operation $\Delta$, then $e$ is an <b>identity </b>or <b>identity
element </b>for the structure. Such an element
is also called a <b>unit
element</b> or <b>unity.</b></p>

<p>A<b> <a
name=rightwithidentity>ring with identity</a></b> may mean a ring that has an identity
element, but it can also mean a ring subject to an algebraic identity.</p>

<h4>Identity function</h4>

<p>For a given set $S$, the function from $S$ to $S$
that takes every element of $S$ to itself is called the <b>identity
function.  </b>(More about that <a href="MMFuncExamples.htm#identityfunction">here</a>.)
This is an example of a <a href="MMMoreLanguage.htm#overloadednotation">polymorphic
definition.</a>  </p>

<p>The identity function on $S$ is the identity element of
the algebraic structure consisting of all functions from a set $S$ to
itself with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition">composition</a>
as operation.</p>

<h2><a name=if>if</a></h2>

<h4>In conditional assertions </h4>

<p>The ways <b>if </b>is
used in stating conditional assertions is discussed <a
href="MMConditional.htm#howword">here.</a>  See also<a
href="#let"> let</a>.</p>

<h4>In definitions </h4>

<p>It
is a convention that, in a <a href="MMDefs.htm">definition</a>, the word <b>if</b> used to introduce the word being defined
means "if and only if".</p>

<p><phead>Example: </phead>(a) "An integer is <b>even </b>if it is
divisible by $2$."</p>

<p>Some authors regularly use  <a
href="#ifandonlyif">if and only if</a> or "iff" in a definition, so that definition would be worded:</p><p>(b) "An integer is <b>even </b>if and only if it
is divisible by $2$."</p>

<p class=noind>
But note:  The following statement
is <i>not</i> a definition, but an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessary_and_sufficient_conditions">equivalence</a>:</p><p>(c) "An integer is divisible by $2$  if and only if it is divisible by $–2$."
</p>

<p>Even though "if and only if" is used in both
(b) and (c), they don’t have the same status.   In statement (b) the left side and the right side are
not symmetric.  The point of statement (b) is to give a meaning to the
left side.  Statement
(c) <i>is</i> symmetric; you could just as
correctly say, "An integer is divisible by $–2$ if and
only if it is divisible by $2$ ."</p>

<h4>In the precondition of a definition </h4>

<p><b>If </b>can be used in the <a href="MMDefs.htm#precondition">pre­condition</a> of a definition to introduce some requirements on an <a
href="MMMathObj.htm">object</a> mentioned in the definition.  For example,  definition
(a) above could have been worded this way:</p>

<p>"If $n$ is an integer, then it is <b>even</b> if
it is divisible by $2$ ."</p>

<h2><a name=ifandonlyif>if and only if </a></h2>

<p>If $P$ and $Q$ are two <a
href="MMMathEnglish.htm#assertion">assertions</a>, the statement "$P$ <b>if
and only if</b> $Q$" is an assertion that $P$ and $Q$  are <a
href="MMConditional.htm#equivalent">equivalent</a>. That statement may be abbreviated "$P$
<b>iff </b>$Q$".  </p>

<a  name=imply><h2><a href="MMConditional.htm#imply">imply</a> </h2>

<h2><a name=in>in</a></h2>

<p><b>In</b> is used in mathematical discourse in many of its normal English
meanings, as well as in some meanings that are peculiar to mathematics. </p>

<ul>
<li>

"$A$ is<b> in </b>$B$"
can mean $A$ is an <a href="MMSetNotation.htm#elementnotation">element of</a> $B$ ($A\in B$).</li>

<li>

"$A$ is <b>in</b> $B$"
can mean $A$ is a <a href="MMSetSubset.htm#subset">subset of</a> $B$ ($A\subseteq B$). </li>

<li>

You may say "$A$ is <b>in</b>
$B$" when $A$ is an <a href="#equation">equation</a>
whose solution set is included in $B$, or a geometric figure whose points
are included in $B$. For example,
"The unit circle ${{x}^{2}}+{{y}^{2}}=1$ is <b>in</b>
the Euclidean plane."</li>

<li>

You may say "$A$ is <b>in </b>$B$" when $B$ is a <a href="MMSymLang.htm#symbolicexpression">symbolic expression</a> and $A$ is part of $B$. Examples:
<ul>
<li>"$x$ is a <a
href="MMVarSub.htm">variable</a><b> in $3{{x}^{2}}+2x{{y}^{3}}$</b>"</li>

<li>
"$3{{x}^{2}}$ is
a <a href="MMSymLang.htm#symbolicterm">term</a> <b>in $3{{x}^{2}}+2x{{y}^{3}}$</b>".
</li>

</ul>

<li>
"$A$ is $P$ <b>in</b> $B$", where $P$ is a
property, may mean that $A$ has property $P$ with respect to $B$,
where $B$ is a constituent of $A$ or a related structure (for example
a containing structure). Examples:
<ul>
<li>
"The set $\{x\in\mathbb{R}|\,0\leq x \text{ and } x\leq 1\}$ is topologically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(mathematics)">closed</a> in $\mathbb{R}$."</li>

<li>If $A$ is a subgroup of the group $B$, then the statement
"$A$ is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_subgroup">normal</a><b>
in </b>$B$" means that $A$ is a normal subgroup of $B$.</li>

<li>"$3{{x}^{2}}+2x{{y}^{3}}$ is differentiable <b>in </b>$x$". (It is also differentiable in $y$).</li>
</li>
</ul>
<li>

You may describe an intersection
using "<b>in</b>". For example, the sets $\{1,2, 3, 4\}$ and $\{1, 3, 5, 7\}$ intersect <b>in</b>  $1$ and $3$.)
</li></ul>



<h2>in general<a name=ingeneral></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
(a) A statement
such as "$P$ is true <b>in general</b>"
may mean that $P$ is true no matter what values you substitute for its
variables. For example,
"the
equation ${{x}^{2}}-1=(x-1)(x+1)$ is true in general"  means that for
all x, ${{x}^{2}}-1=(x-1)(x+1)$ is true. 
</li>

<li>(b) On the other hand, "In general, $P$" may sometimes mean only that there are <i>some special cases</i> where $P$ is true. Example: "In general, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor series</a> of an infinitely differentiable function has an infinite number of terms." (A polynomial is infinitely differentiable and is its own Taylor series, which therefore has only a finite number of terms.) <span class=bluetiny><br />The statement "there are <i>some special cases</i>" does not have a mathematical definition! The phrase just expresses the speaker's attitude toward the cases where $P$ is false.</span>
</li>

<li>
(c) Statements
such as "In general, not $P$" probably mean that "$P$ is <i>not
necessarily</i> true." Example:
"In general, not every subgroup of a group is
normal in the group"  means that an arbitrary subgroup of a group need
not be normal in the group.  The statement specifically implies that there are examples where the
subgroup is not normal in the
group.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ul><li>In most circumstances, you can substitute <a name=generally><b>generally</b>
</a>for "in general".</li>

<li>The <a
href="http://abstractmath.org/Books/handbkhyper.pdf#ingeneral">Handbook article about "in general"</a> has citations for usages (a) and (c), but not for (b), which I have some doubts about.
</li>

<h4>Functions on ordered sets</h4>
<p>These words "increasing", "decreasing" and so on can be used
for functions to and from other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order">ordered sets</a>, as well.</p>


<h4>Sequences</h4>
<p>These words are also used for
sequences, since a sequence is a <a href="MMFuncExamples.htm#indexset">function
on its index set</a>.   For example, a sequence ${{a}_{1}},\,\,{{a}_{2}},\,\,{{a}_{3}},\,\ldots.$ is
<b>increasing </b>if for all $i$ and $j$ in its index set, if $i\lt j$ then ${{a}_{i}}\lt{{a}_{j}}$.</p>



<h2><a name=inequality>inequality</a></h2>

<p>An <b>inequality </b>is an assertion of the form $s\,\alpha

relations $\lt$, $\gt$, $\leq $ or $\geq $.</p>

<h4 class=redit>Examples</h4>

<p>The assertions \[(4+3)^2\gt 8\times 6\] and \[\sin \frac{3\pi}{2}\leq0\] are inequalities.</p>

<p class=smallind>If you are bothered by the second assertion, see <a href="http://abstractmath.org/MM/MMDysfunctional.htm#unnecessarilyweakassertion">unnecessarily weak assertions</a>.</p>

<p class=purpleprose>The word "inequality" is not usually used<br />to mean an assertion of the form "$s\neq

<li>
$A$
is an entry in the list $B$.</li>

<li>
$A$
is an expression in the delimiters $B$.  (For example,"The function inhabiting

<h2><a name=injective>injective</a> </h2>

<p>Functions can have a property called <a

two uses are unrelated.</p>

<h2><a name=input>input</a> </h2>

<p>If $f(x)=x^2+1$, then $f(2)=5$.</p>

</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name=integral>integral</a></h2>

<p><a name="_Toc130095391">This word
has three different meanings. </a></p>

<h4>Being an integer</h4>

<p><b>Integral</b> is used as an adjective to require that the noun phrase it
modifies denote an integer. For example, $8$ is an integral <a
href="#power">power</a> of $2$  but $9$ is not.  This is also used for the more general
notion of algebraic integer (<a
href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AlgebraicInteger.html">MW</a>, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_integer">Wi</a>).</p>

<h4>Antiderivative </h4>

<p>An <b>integral </b>of a <a
href="MMFunctions.htm">function</a> is an
antiderivative of the function.  It may be called the <b>indefinite integral</b>
to distinguish it from the definite integral mentioned below.  The indefinite integral of
$f$ may be denoted by $\int{f(x)\,dx}$ which determines the integral only <a
href="#upto">up to</a> a constant. </p>

<p>You may refer to a <i>specific</i>
antiderivative using the form $\int_{c}^{t}{f(x)\,dx}$.</p>

<p>The word <b>integral </b>is also
used to denote a solution of a more general differential equation. </p>

<h4>Definite integral</h4>

<p><b>Integral </b>is also used to
denote a definite integral:
this operator takes an integrable function and an <a
href="MMSetSpecific.htm#interval">interval</a> (or
more general space) on which the function is defined and produces a number. The
definite integral of $f$ on an interval $ [a, b] $ is denoted $\int_{a}^{b}{f(x)\,\,dx}$ or
$\int_{a}^{b}{f}$.  </p>

<h2><a name=intuition>intuition</a></h2>

<p>Mathematicians may use the word <b>intuition</b> in
referring to some <a href="MMImagesMetaphors.htm#image">image</a> or <a

object.  </p>

<h4 class=redit>Examples</h4>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<p>In such sentences, "just" may commonly be omitted without
changing the meaning, but in many cases it probably shouldn’t
be omitted because it is an important indicator of the logical flow.</p>

<p>Before I did
the research (finding citations of usage) for the <a
href="http://abstractmath.org/Books/handbkhyper.pdf#just">article on "just" in the Handbook</a>, my
own perception of this usage was that the word "just" meant that what followed
was <i>equivalent</i> to what preceded.  That’s a small example of the vital necessity of checking citations before
making pronouncements about math English!</p>

<h2><a name=justincase>just in case</a></h2>
<p>This phrase means that what follows is logically equivalent
 to what precedes.  A search of <a href="http://www.jstor.org/">Jstor</a>
reveals that in math research articles it is used mostly but not entirely by
logicians.</p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><p>
 "An
integer is even <b>just in case</b> it is divisible by $2$ "
<p>

<p>In
ordinary English (used more in Britain than in the USA, I think), "just in
case" means "to guard against the possibility of".    </p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><p>"I will take an umbrella just in case
it rains" means something like "I will take an
umbrella in order to guard against the (undesired) possibility that it might
rain."</p>

<p>This can cause <a href="MMCognitiveDissonance.htm">cognitive dissonance</a>: The statement "An
integer is even <b>just in case</b> it is divisible by $2$ " certainly
does <i>not</i> mean "An integer is even in order to guard against the
possibility that it might be divisible by $2$ ."</p>

<p>A <a href="#theorem">theorem.</a>
 Usually when an author calls a theorem a lemma, the connotation is that the lemma
is not of interest for itself, but is useful in
proving other theorems. However, some lemmas (<b>König's Lemma</b> (<a
href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KoenigsLemma.html">MW</a>, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koenig's_lemma">Wi</a>), <b>Schanuel’s Lemma</b>

<b>Zorn's Lemma</b> (<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ZornsLemma.html">MW</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorn's_Lemma">Wi</a>)) have become quite
famous and are explicitly taught in some courses because of their usefulness. </p>

<p>In old books sometimes the plural of lemma is <b>lemmata.</b></p>

<h2><a name=let>let</a>   </h2>

<p>"Let" is used in several different ways in mathematical
English.</p>

<h4>Introducing a new symbol or name</h4>

<p><a name=newint></a>The most common use of "let" is to introduce
a new symbol or name.  This makes it a kind of<a href="MMDefs.htm">
definition</a>.  The <a href="MMVarMeanings.htm#scope">scope</a> is usually
restricted to the current section of text.  In contrast, the scope of a formal
definition explicitly using the word "definition" is generally the whole
discourse.</p>

<p>There is no logical distinction between
this use of "let" and a formal definition.  The difference apparently concerns
whether the newly introduced expression is for temporary use or meant to hold
throughout the text, and perhaps whether it is regarded as important or not.  </p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><a name=arbobj></a><p>Consider the
theorem </p>

<p>"An <a href="MMIntegers.htm">integer</a><a
href="MMNumberTheory.htm#divides"> divisible</a> by $4$ is divisible by $2$." A proof could begin this way: "Let $n$ be an integer
divisible by $4$." This introduces a new <a
href="MMVarSub.htm">variable</a> symbol  $n$  and <a
href="MMMathEnglish.htm#constraint">constrains</a> it to be divisible by $4$. </p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><p><a name=arbobja></a><p>Suppose the theorem of the preceding example had been stated this way: </p>

<p>"Let  $n$ be an integer.
If $n$ is divisible by $4$ then it is divisible by $2$." Then the proof could begin, "Let  $n$ be divisible
by $4$." In this sentence, $n$
is introduced in the theorem and is further constrained in the proof. </p>


<p class='headed'><a name=minor></a>These two examples illustrate that whether
a new symbol is introduced or a previous symbol is given a new interpretation
is a minor matter of wording; the underlying logical structure of the <a
href="#argument">argument</a> is the same. </p>








<h4>To consider successive cases</h4>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4>

<p>"Let $n \gt 0$.... Now let $n\le 0$" <b>If</b>, <b>assume</b>
and <b>suppose</b> seem to be more common that "let" in this use. </p>


<h4>To introduce an arbitrary object</h4>

<p><a name=arb></a>To pick an unrestricted <a
href="MMMathObj.htm">object</a> from a collection with the purpose of proving
an assertion about all elements in the collection using <a
href="MMUnivTrue.htm#universalgeneralization">universal generalization.</a>  Often used with <a
href="#arbitrary">arbitrary</a>. <b>If</b>,
<b>assume</b> and <b>suppose</b><b> </b>can be
used here. </p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><p>If you are writing a proof of a theorem that claims
something is true about all prime numbers, your proof might start out: "Let $n$
be a prime number".  During the proof you can use the fact that $n$ is a
prime number, but you may not make other special assumptions about it.</p>

<h4>To name a witness</h4>

<p><a name=witnessname></a>To provide a word or symbol for an arbitrary object from a nonempty
collection of objects.   Equivalently, to choose a <a
href="MMQuantifiers.htm#witness">witness</a> to an existential assertion
that is known to be true.  <b>If</b>, <b>assume</b> and <b>suppose</b><b>
</b>can be used here. </p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><p>In proving a theorem about a differentiable function that is
increasing on some interval and decreasing on some
other interval, you might write: </p>

<p>"Let $a$ and $b$ be real
numbers for which $f'(a)\gt0$ and $f'(b)\lt0$."</p>

<p>These numbers exist by hypothesis.
</p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><p>In the context that  $G$ is known to be a
noncommutative <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_%28mathematics%29">group</a>: </p>

<p>"Let  $x$ and $y$
be elements of  $G$ for which $xy\neq yx$.</p>

<p class='headed'>The following is a more explicit
version of the same assertion: </p>

<p>"Let the noncommutative group $G$
be given. Since $G$ is noncommutative, the collection $\left\{
(x,y)\in G\times G|\,xy\ne yx \right\}$ is nonempty, so we may choose a member
($x$,$y$) of this set..."</p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><a name=pbc></a><p>In proving a
function $F:S\to T$ is <a
href="MMFuncProperties.htm#injective">injective</a>, you might begin with "Let $x,\,\,x'\in S$ be elements for
which $F(x)=F(x')$".  These elements must exist if $F$ is non-injective:
in other words, this begins a proof by <a
href="MMFormsProof.htm#contrapositivemethod">contrapositive</a>. The <a href="MMExistenceStatements.doc">existence
statement</a> for which the elements $x,\,\,x'\in S$ are <a href="MMQuantifiers.htm#witness">witnesses</a> is implied by the assumption that $F$ is not injective.
</p>


<h4>"Let" meaning "define"</h4>

<p><a name=defintro></a><b>Let </b>can be used in the <a
href="MMDefs.htm#defphrase">defining phrase</a> of a definition.</p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><p>"Let an integer be even if it is
divisible by  2." </p>



<p class='headed' >This usage strikes me as unidiomatic. It sounds like a
translation of a French ("Soit...") or German ("Sei...") subjunctive. <b>If</b>,
<b>assume</b> and <b>suppose</b> cannot be used here.
</p>

<h4>Other words can replace "let" -- sometimes</h4>
<p>
<b>Assume</b>, <a href="#define">define</a>, <a href="#if">if</a>, and <a href="#suppose">suppose</a>
can be used instead of "let”. The syntax varies depending on which word is used, and some of these words cannot be used in certain situations. There are other subtle differences as well.
</p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><p>
You can
say,
<ul>
<li>
"Let $X$ be $\ldots$ ”, but you have to say
</li>

<li>"Assume [Suppose] $x$ is $\ldots$ ” </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4>
<ul>
<li>"If
$x = 1$” cannot be a complete sentence, but
</li>
<li>
"Let $x = 1$” is a complete sentence.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class=redit>Examples:</h4><p>All these sentences have the same mathematical
content.</p>

<ul><li>"Let $S$
be an odd integer.  Then $S$ is not divisible by $2$". </li>

<li>"Assume
$S$ is
an odd integer.  Then $S$ is not divisible by $2$". </li>

<li>"Suppose
$S$ is
an odd integer.  Then $S$ is not divisible by $2$". </li>

<li>"If
$S$ is
an odd integer, then $S$ is not divisible by $2$."</li>
</ul>
<p>The periods after "integer" in the first three sentences may
be replaced by a semicolon, but not by a comma.  The comma in the fourth
sentence cannot be replaced by a period; "If $S$ is an
odd integer" is not a complete sentence.</li>

<h2><a name=linear>linear</a></h2>

<ul><li>
a) A function $f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ is <b>linear </b>if
it is of the form $f(x)=ax+b$, where $a$ and $b$  are real numbers. 
The graph of such a function is a straight line.</li>

<li>
b) If $M$ and $N$ are modules over a ring $A$,
then a map $f:M\to N$ is <b>linear </b>(or an $A$-<b>linear map) </b>if
for all $a$ and $a'$  in $A$ and $m$ and $m's$  in
$M$, $f(am+a'm')=af(m)+a'f(m')$.</li>
</ul>

<p class='headed'><phead>Note: </phead>An $F$ vector space over a field $F$ is
a module over $F$.  In particular, $\mathbb{R}$ is a vector space over
itself, so the two definitions of linear for functions $f:\mathbb{R}\to
\mathbb{R}$ conflict. In particular, an example of (a) with $b\neq0$ is not an example of (b).  This conflict may be avoided by referring to functions
satisfying (a) as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation">affine</a>.  But it might be a problem explaining to a high school
student that a function whose graph is a straight line is not necessarily
linear.</p>

<h2><a name=logarithm>logarithm</a></h2>

<p>For real numbers $a$ and $x$
with $a$ positive and not equal to 1,  the expression ${{\log }_{a}}x$
denotes the number $y$ for which  ${{a}^{y}}=x$.   The number $a$ is
called the <b>base</b>.  </p>

<p>You will quite often see the
expression "log $x$" with the base omitted (so that the
expression has a <a href="MMMoreLanguage.htm#suppressionofparameters">suppressed
parameter</a>.)  This expression can mean three different
things, depending on the specialty of the text.  </p>

<ul>
<li>
 In pure
math research
articles and books, the base is usually e.  This is called the natural logarithm.  In calculus texts it may be
written "ln".</li>

<li>
 In texts
by scientists
and in many modern calculus texts, the base is likely to be $10$.</li>

<li>
 In computing
science,
the base is likely to be $2$  and may be written "lg".</li>

<p>To <b>maximize</b> a function is

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><p>"To say that an integer is

<h4>Implies</h4>

<p>To say that an <a

$Q$. </p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><p>"We have proved that $4$ divides $n$. This <b>means</b> in particular that n is even." </p>

<p class='headed'>Math authors do not always make it explicit whether
they are using "mean" to give a definition or to describe an implication.</p>

<h4>Average</h4>

<p><b>Mean</b> is also a technical term, referring to the
arithmetic average.</p>

<h2><a name=minus>minus</a></h2>

<p>The word <b>minus</b> can refer to both the <a
href="MMAbsAlg.htm#binaryoperation">binary
operation</a> on numbers, as in the expression $a-b$, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_operation">unary
operation</a> of taking the <a name=negative><b>negative</b></a>: negating $b$ gives
$-b$. In current usage in American high schools, $a – b$ would be
pronounced "a minus b", but $–b$ would be pronounced
"negative $b$". The older usage for $-b$ was "minus $b$"
and many old fuddy duddy college teachers like me forget and call it "minus $b$"
sometimes.  </p>

<p>Don’t assume a minus sign before an expression makes
it negative.  The expression "$–t$" denotes a positive number 
if $t$ happens to be $–42$.   Don’t be misled by the fact that we call it
"negative $t$".  See also <a
href="#subtract">subtraction</a>.</p>

<h2><a name=modulo>modulo</a></h2>

<p>The phrase "$x$ is the same as $y$ <b>modulo</b> $E$"
means that $x$ and $y$ are elements of some set, $E$ is an <a
href="MMEquivalenceRelations.htm">equivalence
relation</a> on the set, and $x\, E\, y$. There are variants to this usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>$x$
is the same as $y$ mod $E$.</li>

<li>$x
= y$ modulo $ E$ ( or mod $E$).</li>

<li>$x
\equiv y$ modulo $ E$ ( or mod $E$).</li>

<li>$x$
is the same as $y$ <a name=upto> <b>up to</b></a>  $E$. </li></ul>

<p>The word arose from a special equivalence relation in <a
href="MMNumberTheory.htm">number
theory</a>, which has two conflicting special notations in
pure math and computing science that I have seen cause confusion among
students. </li>



<p>For integers $a$, $b$ and $n$, the expression $a\equiv
b\bmod n$ means that $a – b$ is divisible by $n$.  (This
relation is an equivalence relation. For example, $23\equiv 11\bmod 3$ and $-4\equiv 16\bmod 5$.  In this usage, the symbol "mod"
occurs as part of a three-place assertion. </p>

<p class='smallind' >
In this usage in number theory, the symbol "$\equiv$" does not mean "identical to".
</p>


<h4>Mod in computer languages</h4>

<p>In most computer languages and in computing science texts,
the expression "$a\bmod n$" means the <b>least nonnegative remainder</b>
obtained when $a$ is divided by $n$.  For example, $23 \bmod 3 = 2$  and $-4 \bmod 5 = 1$.  (See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation">Wikipedia article on modulo</a> for details.)  In this usage, mod is a <a
href="MMFuncExamples.htm#binaryoperation">binary operation</a> on the
integers.</p>

<h4><a name=colloquialmod>Colloquial mod</a></h4>

<p>People
in math-related fields use "mod" in phrases such as "The
administration kept my salary the same modulo [or mod] inflation". Presumably
the equivalence relation here is something like: "One dollar in 2002 is
equivalent to $1.02 in 2003." </p>

<p>In particular, a statement such as "The alternating group on
three letters is the same as the cyclic group of order $3$ up to isomorphism" (less often, "modulo isomorphism") refers to the equivalence
relation of two structures being <a
href="MMMorphisms.htm">isomorphic.

<ul>

<li><b>Multiplication of numbers</b>: The <a href="MMFuncNotation.htm#commonarithmeticoperations">product</a> of $3$ and $5$ is $15$, typically denoted by $3\times5$. (See <a href="MMFuncNotation.htm#commonarithmeticoperations">Common arithmetic operations</a>.)
</li>
<li><b>Multiplication of variables in algebra</b>, typically denoted by <a href="http://abstractmath.org/MM/MMFuncNotation.htm#juxtaposition"><b>juxtaposition</b></a>; for example, the product of $a$ and $b$ is denoted by $ab$.</li>

<li>Many structures studied in undergraduate math courses involve a binary operation that is typically called multiplication and denoted by juxtaposition. For example,  the product of two elements $a$ and $b$ of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)">group</a> may be denoted by $ab$.</li>

</ul>

<h4>A trap many students fall into</h4>

<p>Multiplication of numbers is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property"><b>commutative</b></a>: For any numbers $a$ and $b$, $ab=ba$. This is <i>not necessarily true in groups</i>. For example, let $a$ be the permutation of the set $\{1,2,3\}$ that switches $1$ and $2$ and let $b$ be the permutation of the set $\{1,2,3\}$ that switches $2$ and $3$.  Then the product $ab$ (do $a$ then $b$) takes $1$ to $3$, $3$ to $2$ and $2$ to $1$, whereas the product $ba$ takes $1$ to $2$, $2$ to $3$ and $3$ to $1$.</p> 

<p class=smallind>Some group theory texts write "$ab$" to mean "do $b$ then $a$".  Some of them are even nice enough to tell you which way they are doing it.</p>

<p class=bluesmall>Countless legions of group theory students have quite unconsciously tried to prove some theorem by writing (for example) $aba=a^2b$ and similar blunders.</p>

<p>The definition of "group" <i>does not require that multiplication be commutative</i>, and:</p>

<p class=purpleprose>If a math definition defines a word<br />that is familiar to you in some other context,<br />you can't use properties it has in that context in a proof.</p>

<a name="establishnotation"></a>
</ul>

<h4>Establish notation</h4>

<p>Mathematicians may say, "Let's <a name=establishnotation><b>establish</b></a><b>
some notation</b>",  meaning they will introduce a specific combination of
certain <a href="MMSymLang.htm">symbols</a> to refer to a particular <a
href="MMMathObj.htm">mathematical object</a>. This is a type of <a

<a  name="now">
<h2>now</h2>

<p>The word "<b>now</b>" is used in at least three different ways in mathematical writing. They are not always easy to distinguish, but only the first usage listed below can cause an inexperienced reader of math to miss a hidden meaning.</p>

 
<h3>Introduce new notation</h3>

<p>"<b>Now</b>” may indicate that new notation
or assumptions are about to be introduced. This is often used to
begin a new argument.</p>  <p class=purpleprose>This use of the word <span class=red>now</span> may have the effect<br />of canceling
assumptions<br />made in the preceding text.</p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4>

<p>"We have shown that if $x\in A$, then $x\in B$. Now suppose $x\notin A$..."</p>

<p>In this text, the author supposes $x\notin A$ presumably because they are doing a <a href="http://abstractmath.org/MM/MMFormsProof.htm#proofbycases">proof by cases</a>.</p> 


<h3>Bring up a fact that is needed</h3>

<p>"Now” may be used to point out
a fact that is already known or easily deduced and that will be used in the next step of the proof.</p>
<h4 class=redit>Example 2</h4>
<p>In a situation where we already know that $x=7$, one could say, "We have that $x^2+y^2=100$. Now, $x=7$, so $y=\sqrt{5}$."
This is similar to the second meaning given for <a href="#but">but</a>.</p>

<h3>Here</h3>

<p>"Now” may simply refer to the point in the text at which
it occurs.</p>  

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4>

<p>"We are now in a position to give a conceptual proof of Pringsheim's Theorem."</p>

<p>The metaphor
here is that the reader has been reading straight through the text (unlike a <a href="http://abstractmath.org/MM/MMMoreLanguage.htm#grasshopper">grasshopper</a>) and at the current
moment she sees this word "now”.  As such it does not really add
anything to the meaning.</p>

<p>The <a href="/Books/handbkhyper.pdf#now">Handbook article on "now"</a> includes several more examples.</p>

<h2>obvious</h2>

<p>A theorem is said to be <b>obvious</b> if the speaker’s
mental representation of the <a href="MMMathObj.htm">mathematical
object</a> mentioned in the theorem makes the truth of the fact
immediately perceivable. "Obvious" should be used carefully; you need to be
sure the listener shares your particular mental representation!   See also <a

<h2><a name=order>order</a></h2>

<p>The <b>order </b>of a mathematical object is a number (or
other math object) associated with that object.  What "order" means
depends on the mathematical specialty.  </p>

<h4 class=redit>Examples</h4>
<ul>

<li> The<b>
order</b> of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation">differential
equation</a> is the highest derivative occurring in the equation.  For example
the order of the equation $u''-2u'=u$ is $2$.  <b>Warning: </b> The order of $u''-2u'=3{{u}^{17}}$ is
also $2$.  </li>

<li> A
very common meaning for <b>order </b>is the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality">cardinality</a> of some set
associated with the structure.  For example, the order of a <a
href="MMGroups.doc">group</a> is the number of elements in the group. 

</li>

<li>
 An
<i>element</i> of a group also has an <b>order, </b>which is the
order in the preceding sense of the cyclic subgroup it generates (it may be
infinite).
</li>

 <li><b>Degree
</b>is frequently used similarly.  Some structures, for example <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_group">permutation groups</a>,
have both an order and a degree, and those two words mean different things.
</li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page"></a>

<li> <b>Order
</b>can also refer to an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_theory">ordering</a>,
as in "Consider the usual order on the reals."
</li>

<li>See also <a href="#rank"><b>rank</b></a>.</li>

</ul>

<h2><a name=orderedpair>ordered pair</a></h2>

<ul>

<li>For any <a href="MMMathObj.htm">math objects</a> $a$ and $b$, the <b>ordered pair</b> $(a,b)$ is a math object determined completely by the fact that its first coordinate is $a$ and its second coordinate is $b$. (This is a <a href="MMDefs.htm#specifications">specification</a> of "ordered pair", not a definition.)</li>

<li>The operative principle of ordered pairs is: <b>$(a,b)=(c,d)$ if and only if $a=c$ and $b=d$.</b> This is all you need to know about ordered pairs.</li>

<li>For example, $(3,5)$ is the ordered pair with first coordinate $3$ and second coordinate $5$.  It is not the same as the ordered pair $(5,3)$.  In contrast, the <i>set</i> $\{3,5\}$ is the same set as $\{5,3\}$.</li>

<li>The entries in $(a,b)$ can be any math object, not just numbers.  For example, the ordered pair $(\mathbb{R},42)$ has first coordinate the set of all real numbers and the second coordinate the number $42$. Yes, this is a ridiculous example.  But it shows the generality of the concept of "ordered pair".</li>

<h2><a name=partition>partition</a></h2>

<p>The word <b>partition</b> has several distinct meanings in
math.  </p>

<ul>
<li> A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_a_set">partition
of a set</a> into disjoint blocks (same as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation">equivalence relation</a>).</li>

<p> All of these ideas

genuinely distinct ideas.  </p>

<h2><a name=permutation>permutation</a></h2>

<p><b>Permutation</b> is defined in
the literature in two different ways: </p>
<ul>
<li> A <b>permutation</b> of an $n$-element set is a
sequence of length $n$ in which each element of the set appears once.  This
is discussed in detail in <a
href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Permutation.html">Mathworld</a>.</p>

<li> A <b>permutation</b> of a set is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection">bijection</a> from the set
to itself. </p>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the two definitions can
be converted into each other, but they give different mental images. The
discussion in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation">Wikipedia</a>
gives both definitions.</p>

<h2><a name=power></a>power</h2>



<p>Here are three variant phrases that say that $125=5^3$:</p>

<ul>

<li>"$125$ is a power of
$5$ with exponent $3$".</li>

<li>"$125$ is the third power of $5$".</li>

<li>"$125$ is $5$ to the third power".</li>
 
</ul>

<p>Some students are confused by such statements, and conclude that $3$ is the "power".  This usage appears in print in Wikipedia in its entry on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation">Exponentiation</a> (as it was on 22 November 2016):</p>


<p class=boxed>...$b^n$ is the product of multiplying $n$ bases:

    \[b^n = \underbrace{b \times \cdots \times b}_n\]

In that case, $b^n$ is called the $n$-th power of $b$, or $b$ raised to the power $n$.</p>

<p>As a result, students (and many mathematicians) refer to $n$ as the "power" in any expression of the form "$a^n$". The number $n$ should be called the "exponent". The word "power" should refer only to the result $a^n$. I know mathematical terminology is pretty chaotic, but it is silly to refer both to $n$ and to $a^n$ as the "power".</p>

<p class=smallind>Almost as silly as using $(a,b)$ to refer to an open interval, an ordered pair and the GCD. (See <a href="MMDelimiters.htm#notationab">The notation $(a,b)$</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Suggestion for lexicographical research:</b> How widespread does referring to $n$ as the "power" come up in math textbooks or papers? (See <a href="MMAttitude.htm#usage">usage</a>.)</p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><p>"<b>Recall</b> that an integer is

<p class='headed'>The intent seems to be that the

<h2><a name=revise>revise</a></h2>

<p>In the United States, to <b>revise</b>
a document means to change
it, hopefully improving it in the process. Speakers influenced by British
English use "revise" to mean what Americans mean by "review".  In particular,
students may talk about "revising" for an upcoming test. In this case there
is no implication that anything will (or will not) be changed. </p>

<h2><a name=root>root</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>A <b>root </b>of an equation $f$($x$)

<li>This value $c$ is also

<li>The <b>$n$th root</b> of a

this situation appears to me to be more common that using "zero",  particularly
when the function is a polynomial.  <a

<h2><a name=subscript>subscript</a></h2>

<p>An expression such as ${{a}_{2}}$ commonly means that $a$

<h2><a name=subtract>subtract</a></h2>

<h4>Removing objects from a collection</h4>

<p>In ordinary English, if you <b>subtract</b> from a
collection you make it smaller, and if you <a name=add><b>add</b></a>
to a collection you make it bigger. </p>

<h4>Applying the operation of subtraction</h4>

<p>When $a$ and $b$ are numbers, to <b>subtract</b> $b$ from $a$ means to add $-b$ to $a$, written $a-b$.  This process can clash with the ordinary English meaning of "subtract".</p>

<ul>
<li>
If you subtract $3$ from $5$ you get $2$, which is smaller than $5$.  No problem.</li>

<li>But if you subtract $-3$ from $5$ you get $8$, which is <i>bigger</i>. </li>
</ul>

<p>This difference in the mental image of subtraction can may you think, for example, that $x-y$ must be smaller that $x$.  But that is wrong if $y$ is negative!</p>

<p>Both these usages (adding to a collection and
applying the operation of addition) occur in mathematical writing.</p>

<h2><a name=suchthat>such that</a></h2>

<p>For an <a

</p>

<h4 class=redit>Examples</h4>

<ul><li>"Let  $n$ be an integer <b>such that</b> $n\gt 2$"
means that in any following assertions that refer to  $n$, one can
assume that $n\gt 2$. </li>

<li>"The set of integers $n$

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ul>
<li><a name=strem></a> In pronouncing $\exists x\,P(x)$ the phrase "such
that" is usually inserted. This is not done for the <a
href="MMUnivTrue.htm#universalquantifier">universal quantifier</a>.  So "$\exists x(x\gt 0)$" is pronounced "There is an $x$ such
that $x$ is greater than $0$", but " $\forall x(x\gt 0)$" is pronounced "For all $x$, $x$ is greater than $0$". </li>

<li>Yes, I know that "$\forall x(x\gt 0)$" is false. </li>

</ul>


<h2><a name=sufficient>sufficient</a></h2>

if the statement "If $P$, then $Q$" is true (see <a href="MMConditional.htm">conditional assertion</a>.)   You can also say $P$
<a name=suffice><b>suffices</b></a> for $Q$. The idea behind the word is
that <span class=purple>to know that $Q$ is true it is enough to know that $P$ is
true</span>. </li>

<h2><a name=superscript>superscript</a>  </h2>

<ul>
<li>
An expression such as ${{a}^{n}}$ may denote $a$ to the

</li>

</ul>

<h2><a name=symbol>symbol</a></h2>

<p>As used in math, a <b>symbol</b>, is either

<ul>

<li>A typographical
character, such as "$x$", "$\phi
$", "$\bigcup{{}}$" and $\infty $.
</li>

<li>
An expression that stands for something. For
example, the individual symbols just listed each will have a meaning in a math text (not always the same meaning). The expression can also be compound; for example the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LegendreSymbol.html">Legendre
Symbol</a> has the form ($a$/$p$), where $a$ is an integer and $p$
is a <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Prime.html">prime number</a>.  
</li>
</ul>

<p>These two meanings are genuinely different.  The symbol $\phi$ has <i>two distinct meanings</i> in these sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
"$\phi$" is pronounced "fee".
</li>

<li>
$\phi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$
</li>
</ul>

<p> It is best if an author puts quotes around the symbol when they mean the typographical symbol, but they don't always do that. See <a
href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/search/?query=symbol&amp;x=9&amp;y=3">Mathworld</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol">Wikipedia</a> for much more about symbols.</p>


<h2><a name=symbolmanipulation>symbol manipulation</a></h2>

<p><b>Symbol manipulation </b> is the use of algebraic rules,
or rules of some other computational system, to change a <a

equivalent one.  For example, you can change $3{{x}^{2}}+3$ to the equivalent
expression $3({{x}^{2}}+1)$ using the <a
href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Distributive.html">distributive law</a> for
algebra, and you can change $\int_{1}^{3}{{{x}^{2}}+{{x}^{3\,}}\,dx}$ into $\int_{1}^{3}{{{x}^{2}}\,dx}+\int_{1}^{3}{{{x}^{3}}\,dx}$ using
a rule of integration.</p>

to a <a

</ul>


<p>These two meanings are related:
the trigonometric tangent of an angle $\theta$ is by definition the length of a
certain line segment (red in the picture) tangent to the circle of radius 1. The length of the brown line is $\cos \theta$ and that of the green line is $\sin \theta$, which by similar triangles gives you the equation \[\tan\theta=\frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}\]</p>

<h2><a name=term>term</a></h2>

<p>The word <b>term</b> is used is
several ways in math English. </p>

<h4>A constituent of a sum or sequence</h4>

<p>A term is one constituent of a sum or sequence (finite or infinite), in contrast to a <a

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4><p>The terms in the expression ${{x}^{2}}+2x+1$
are ${{x}^{2}}$, $2x$ and $1$.  </p>

<h4>A symbolic expression denoting a mathematical object</h4>

<p> This
is discussed <a href="MMSymLang.htm#symbolicterm">here</a>.  Note that
this use and the preceding one conflict. For example, the expression "${{x}^{3}}\left(
{{y}^{2}}-1 \right)$" contains symbolic terms ${{x}^{3}}$and ${{y}^{2}}-1$,
which would in math English be called <b>factors</b> rather than terms.  </p>

<h4>In terms of</h4>

<li>If you hear someone say "I

$4 + 6 =10$, and  $6$, $8$ and $10$ are all even."</li>

<li>That

<h2><a name=theorem>theorem</a></h2>

<p>
To call an statement a <b>theorem</b> is to claim that the statement has been proved.</p>


<ul><li>
In texts the <a href="MMMathReasoning.htmm">proof</a> is
usually given after the theorem has been stated. In that case (assuming the proof is correct) it is still true that in
real time the theorem "has been
proved"!

<li>
Some authors use the word "theorem" only for assertions they regard as important,
and use the word <b>proposition</b>
for less important ones. See also <a

<h4>Degrees and radians</h4>

<p>If you write "$\sin x$" meaning
the sine of $x$ degrees, you are not using the same
function as when you write "$\sin x$", meaning the sine of $x$ radians. They have different derivatives, for example:  Let $\sin x$
denote the sine of $x$ radians and $\text{sind}\ x$ the sine of $x$ degrees,
so that $\text{sind}\,x=\sin \frac{\pi }{180}x$.  Then $\frac{d\sin x}{dx}=\cos
x$ but $\frac{d\,\text{sind}\,x}{dx}=\frac{\pi }{180}\cos x$.</p>

<p>The same remark may be made of the
other trig functions.  In postcalculus pure mathematics "$\sin x$"
nearly always refers to the sine of $x$ radians, often
without explicitly noting the fact. This is not true for texts written by non-mathematicians, who at least often
use the degree sign to tell you their meaning.</p>

<h4>Variations in usage</h4>
<ul>
<li>
In the USA you calculate the sine function on the unit
circle by starting at $(1, 0)$ and going counterclockwise: the sine is the projection on the y-axis.</li><li>In some other
countries (for example, Hong Kong secondary schools) you may start at $(0,1)$ and go <i>clockwise</i> (the sine is the
projection on the x-axis).  I learned this from students.  </li>

<li>Students
educated in Europe may not have heard of the secant
function. They would simply write ${{\cos }^{-1}}$.</li>

<li>You usually write evaluation of trig functions by <a href="http://abstractmath.org/MM/MMFuncNotation.htm#juxtaposition">juxtaposition</a>
(with a small space for clarity), thus:  $\sin x$ instead
of $\sin(x)$. Students sometimes read "$\sin x$" as multiplication. </li>

<p>Here is a scenario that exemplifies (a):</p>

<ul>
<li>A

elements of $B$ of the form $F(a)$ for some $a\in A$. </li>

<li>It

<ul>
<li>
When a class is first introduced to proof techniques  the instructor should explicitly describe rewriting by definitions with several examples. </li>

 <li>After that, the instructor can say that a proof follows by rewriting by definitions and make it clear that the students will have to do the work (then or later).
</li>

<li>
Such a proof is justly called "trival" but <i>saying it is trivial is also a putdown if no one has pointed out the procedure of rewriting by definitions.</i>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 class=redit>Example:</h4>

<p>This example illustrates (b).</p>
<p class='headed'><phead>Theorem:  </phead>
Let $G$ be a finite <a href="MMGroups.htm">group</a>
and $H$ a subgroup of index $2$  (meaning it has half the number of elements
of the group).  Then $H$ is <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_subgroup">normal</a> in $G$.</p>

<p> Basic facts about groups and subgroups learned in first semester abstract algebra:
<ul>
<li>
A subgroup of a group determines a partition consisting of left <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coset">cosets</a> and another partition of
right cosets, each (in the finite case) with the same number of elements as the subgroup.
</li>

<li>
A subgroup is a left coset of itself and also a right coset of itself.
</li>

<li>If <i>every</i> left coset is also a right coset and vice versa (so the two partitions just mentioned are the same), then by definition the subgroup is normal in the group.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Now if $H$ has index $2$ that means that each partition consists of two cosets.  In both cases, one of them has to be $H$, so the other one has to be $G\setminus H$, which must therefore be a left <i>and</i> right coset of $H$.  So $H$ is normal in $G$.</p>
<p>
So once you understand the basics about cosets and normal subgroups, the fact that $H$ has to be normal if it is of index $2$ is "obvious". I don't think you should call this "trivial".  Best to say it is "obvious if you have a clear understanding of cosets of groups".</p>

<p><a href="MMMathEnglish.htm#assertion">Assertions</a> with variables in them need not be either
true or false. </p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4>
<p>If $n$ is an integer, the statement
"$n \gt  7$" is neither true nor false as long as nothing is known about $n$. 
If you know $n = 42$, then you know that "$n \gt  7$" is true.  If
you know that $n \gt  4$, you still don’t know the truth value of "$n
\gt  7$". 
In this situation, some authors say the truth value is <b>indeterminate.</b></p>

<p>
In formal <a href="MMMathReasoning.htm#mathlogic">mathematical logic</a>, a statement or an assertion becomes a <a href="MMMathObj.htm">math object</a>, although this point is not often made clear in logic texts. An assertion with variables is a <b>variable</b> math object whose values range over $\{\text{true},\text{false},\text{indeterminate}\}$.  See <a href="/Word%20Press/?p=538">my post on variables</a>.

<h2><a name=two>two</a></h2>

<p>In mathematical discourse, two <a
href="MMMathObj.htm">mathematical
objects</a> can be one object!  This is because two distinct names for a particular kind of math object usually are allowed
to have the same value unless some word such as "distinct" is used to ensure that they are
different. </p>

<h4 class=redit>Examples</h4>

<ul>
<li>
 "The sum of any two even integers is even".  In
this statement, the two integers are allowed to be the same.   It is true in any case. 
</li>
<li>
"Are there two positive integers $m$ and $n$, both greater than $1$, satisfying $mn=9$?".  The only answer is $m=n=3$.  <i>This question should never be stated that way.</i>  Either say "two distinct positive integers" or don't ask the question (in my opinion).
</li>
</ul>

<p>Once upon a time (before October 2006), <a name=usually>Wikipedia’s</a> definition of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra">boolean algebra</a> said
until recently that a boolean algebra has "…two elements called $0$ and $1$…"  It
did not say they must be distinct in the axiom but in the examples it said that
the two-element boolean algebra is the simplest example.</p>

<h2><a name=withoutlossofgenerality>without loss of generality </a></h2>

<p>A proof of an assertion
involving two elements $x$ and $y$ of some mathematical
structure $S$ might appear to require
consideration of two cases in which $x$ and $y$ are related in
different ways to each other.  For example
for some assertion $P$, $P(x, y)$ or $P(y, x)$ could hold. However, if there is a symmetry of $S$
that interchanges $x$ and $y$ without affecting the property in question, you may need to consider
only one case. In that case, the proof may begin with a remark such as,</p>

<p>"<b>Without loss of generality</b>, we may assume $P(x,
y)$."</p>

<p><a name=wlog><b>WLOG</b></a><b> </b>is an abbreviation for
this phrase.</p>

<h4 class=redit>Example</h4>

<p>Let $r$ and $s$ be real numbers. The <b>mean</b> (or <b>average</b>) of $r$ and $s$ is $\frac{r+s}{2}$. You would expect that the average is between $r$ and $s$ in value. Here is a formal proof that $\frac{r+s}{2}$ is between $r$ and $s$:</p> 

<p>Assume <span class=bluesmall>without loss of generality</span> that $r\lt s$. Then $\frac{r}{2}\lt\frac{s}{2}$, so \[r=\frac{r+r}{2}\lt\frac{r+s}{2}\lt\frac{s+s}{2}=s\]
</p>

<p>The reason you can assert WLOG in this case is that if $r\gt s$ then you can simply switch their names. You can do this because <span class=bluesmall>if a number is between $r$ and $s$ then it is between $s$ and $r$</span>.  That property of betweenness is the symmetry referred to in the definition of WLOG above.</p>
