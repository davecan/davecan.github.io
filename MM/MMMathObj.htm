<h1>Mathematical objects</h1>



<h4 class='proc'><a name="mathematical_objects"> Mathematical
objects </a> are what we talk and write
about when we do math.</h4>

<ul>
<li> Numbers, functions, triangles, matrices, groups and more complicated things such as vector spaces and infinite series are all examples of <b>mathematical objects</b>. See <a href="#examplesmathobjs">Examples.</a></li>

<li>This chapter discusses <b> how
we think about</b> math objects <i>in general</i>. </li>

<li>Other parts of abstractmath.org discuss how we think about <i>particular kinds</i> of math objects, such as <a href="MMSets.htm">sets</a>
and <a href="MMNumbers.htm">numbers</a>.</li>

</ul>
<a name="reallyare"></a>

<p class=purpleprose>Math objects are <span class=red>not physical
objects,</span><br />
but we think about them and talk about them<br />as if they were.</p>

<p>I will not go into what abstract or math objects "<b>really are</b>". For the purposes of doing math,
what we need to understand is (among other things) <i>how to think about them,</i> not what they "are".<a name="_Mathematical_objects"></a>
</p>



<h4 class='proc'>There are other types of non-physical objects. </h4>
<ul>
 <li>Math objects are a type of <b>abstract object</b>, as is for example
the month of September or an organizational tree. <a href="#_Abstract_objects">More
about abstract objects</a>.</li>

<li>Math objects are similar to <b>fictional objects</b>, such
as a unicorn or Darth Vader. <a href="#_Fictional_objects">More about
fictional objects. </a> </li>
<li>
When this site talks about math objects it (usually)
refers <i>only to math objects constructed from other math objects.</i> We don't talk about "the set of American Presidents" for example. <a

</ul>

<h2><a name="examplesmathobjs"></a>Examples of math objects</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <a
href="MMNumbers.htm">number</a> $42$ is a math object.
The decimal notation '$42$', the binary notation '$101010$', and the hexadecimal notation '$2A$' are three different <i><a
href="MMRepsModels.htm">representations</a></i> of the <i>same</i> math object.</li>

<li> A <b>rectangle</b> is a type of math object.
The rectangle with sides of length $2$,$3$,$2$,$3$
is a particular math
object. </li>

<li>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)"><b>matrix</b></a>

\[\left[
\begin{matrix}
-1 &amp; 5 &amp; -3.2 \\
7.1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 99 &amp; 7 \\\end{matrix}
\right]\]

is <i>one single math object</i>
with 9 entries. </li>

<li>The <b><a
href="MMSets.doc">set</a> $\{3,5,6,7,8\}$</b> is a math
object. It is not five different numbers, it is <i>one object </i> and its defining property is that
only the numbers $3$ , $5$ , $6$ , $7$ and $8$ are elements of the set. </li>

<li> The
set $\mathbb{R}$ of all <a href="MMRealNumbers.htm">real numbers</a> is a single math object with <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncountable">unimaginably many</a> elements.
 <i>It is still one single abstract thing.</i>
</li>
<a name=sinfunctionex></a>

<li> The
<b><a href="MMFunctions.htm">function</a></b> $f(x)=2{{\sin
}^{2}}x-1$ is a math object. You can compute its value at many different
numbers. But the function
$f(x)=2{{\sin }^{2}}x-1$ is a <i>single, static math object. </i> <a
href="MMImagesMetaphorsFunctions.htm#funcmathobj">More.</a></li>

<li>You can <b>take the derivative</b> of $f(x)$. It is <i>another function</i>, namely $f'(x):=4\sin x\cos x$.  <b>Differentiation</b> itself is a math object, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(mathematics)"><b>operator</b></a>, which is a function from a function space to another function space. </li>

<li>In fact a <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_space">function space</a></b> is a math object, for example the space of all differentiable functions from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$. Each point in a function space is a whole function (not individual values of it) considered as a single math object, and on top of that <i>the whole function space</i> is a single math object, conceived of as in one <a href="MMUsefulBehaviors.htm#zoomchunk.htm">chunk</a>.
</li>

<li>Certain branches of math make even more mind-boggling things into math objects, such as <b>equations</b>, <b>diagrams</b>, <b>theorems</b> and <b>proofs</b>. These branches of math include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic">mathematical logic</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">category theory</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory">type theory</a>, which includes the hot new approach called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HoTT">HoTT</a>.</li>

<li>I'm not trying to blow your mind. Well, yes I am a <i>little</i>. But this list gives a clue to how basic a concept "mathematical object" is in math. </li>

</ul>

<h2><a name="_Toc153180896">Talking about math objects</a></h2>

<h4 class='proc'>Mathematicians talk
about math objects as if they were physical objects.
</h4>
<p>Of course we know that a rectangle is not a
physical object like a house and that the number $42$ is not a person. Nevertheless:</p>

<h4 class='proc'>We use the
same grammatical constructs for rectangles as for objects such as houses.</h4>

<ul>
<li>
We say "This
rectangle has area 6 square units" in the same way we say
"This
house has 2000 square feet."
 So we refer to rectangles using <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstrative">demonstratives</a> such as
"this".</li>

<li>A rectangle can be the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_%28grammar%29"> subject </a> or <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_%28grammar%29"> object </a> in a sentence.  "A $180$ degree rotation is a symmetry of a rectangle".</li>

<li> A rectangle can be described as <b>having properties</b> in the same way that we would
describe a physical object having properties. "This rectangle has area 12". </li>

</ul>



<h4 class='proc'> We
use the same grammatical constructs for the number $42$ as for </b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_noun">proper
names.</a>
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
We say "$42$ is an even number" in the same way we say "Mars is a planet". In particular, we do not use "the" to refer
to $42$, just as we don't (in English) say "the Latvia".</li>


 <li class='small' >
We <i>do</i> say "the Bronx" and "the Hague". We used to say "the Ukraine" but the govern&shy;ment of Ukraine objected. On the other hand, the people in the Bronx <i>demand</i> that you use "the".
</li>

<li>We could also give our
rectangle a <b>name</b>, for example "$R$". Then "$R$" would be treated like a proper
noun, as in for example "$R$ is twice as long as it is high", in the same way as we say "Latvia is smaller than Russia".
</li>

</ul>
<p>These facts about how we <i>talk </i> about math objects show how we <i>think </i> about them. We <i>talk</i> about math objects in these ways because we <i>think</i> of
them as things, although not as <i>physical</i> things. </p>



<center><table border="0"><tr><td>
<p class='purpleprose'>Mathematicians
think of math objects as things.<br />
To
understand abstract math,<br />you need to think that way too.
</p></td></tr></table></center>

<p>Remember: I am discussing how we <i>think</i> and <i>talk
about </i>mathematical objects, <i>not what they really are.</i></p></ul>

<h2>Consistent Experience</h2>

<h4 class='proc'>Mathematical objects are like physical objects in that our experience with them is <span class=red>repeatable</span>.</h4>


<ul>
<li> If you
ask some mathematicians about a property of some particular mathematical object
that is not too hard to verify, they will <i>generally agree on
what they say about it.</i> </li>

<li> When
there is disagreement they commonly discover that <i>someone has
made a mistake or has misunderstood the problem. </i> This is
analogous to the way we deal with physical objects. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>Eudora: "Take a prime number as an example, such as $111$."</p>

<p>Rowena: "$111$ is not a prime. It is divisible by $37$."</p>

<p>Eudora: "Well my stars, you're right. I never noticed
that."</p>



<h5>Compare this to</h5>

<p>Eudora: "That tree must be ten feet tall".</p>

<p>Rowena: "It can't be that short, it's taller than the
two-story house next to it."</p>

<p>Eudora: "Oh yeah, good point."</p>

<h4>Examples: </h4>

<ul>
<li>If we ask two people to find the zeroes of a polynomial and
they give different answers, we expect to find their mistake. We don't think
the polynomial  is a physical object but our experience with it is similarly <b>repeatable</b>
and <b>consistent</b>.</li>

 <li>
In the case of a polynomial we probably <i>will</i>
find the mistake. When we are faced with contradictory mathe&shy;matical claims in
complicated situations it may be quite difficult to find the mistake, and we
may have to leave it a mystery.
</li>

<li>We operate as if we believe that <b>mathematics
is consistent</b>:
</li></ul>

</table></center>
<center><table border="0"><tr><td>
<p class='purpleprose'>
We expect that there is always<br /> an
explanation
of an apparent contradiction<br />in math,
even if we cannot find it.

<a name="kinds"></a><a name="properties"></a>
<h2>Kinds and properties</h2>

<h4 class='proc'>Mathematical objects come in different <span class=red>kinds</span> and
have various <span class=red>properties</span>. </h4>

<p>One <b>kind </b>of mathematical object is "<a
href="MMIntegers.htm">integer</a>". Another is "<a
href="MMRealNumbers.htm">real number</a>". The
number $42$ is both an integer and a real number. The number $\pi$ is a real
number but not an integer. A kind of object can be named by a noun or a<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_phrase">noun phrase</a>.</p>

<p>The number $42$ has the <b> property
</b>of being even. The number $43$ is an integer but not an even integer.
Both numbers have the property that they are greater than $40$. Thus
properties can be named by adjectives ("even") or phrases ("greater than $40$").
</p>


<h4 class='proc'>The ideas of kind and property are not really different. </h4>

<p>You could define a kind of mathematical object called <b>ent
</b>to denote an even integer and another kind <b>ont </b>to denote odd
integers. Then you could say "$42$ is an ent" using the same grammar as when you
say "$42$ is an integer". So although we think of "integer" as a <b>kind</b>
of thing and "even" as a <b>property</b> of things, calling even
integers ents allows us to think of "even integer" as a <i>kind</i><a
name="_Toc153180900">.</a></p>


 <p class='smallind' >
Your
 mental image of "kind" may be that it is a more perma&shy;nent and intrin&shy;sic thing than
 "property". (Being human is a kind but being red-headed is a property.) This
 dist&shy;inc&shy;tion is not important when thinking  rigor&shy;ously  about math because in <a
 href="MMImagesMetaphors.htm#inun">rigor&shy;ous mode,</a>
math objects are thought of as <i> inert and unchanging</i>.
</p>


<h2><a name=constructor> Constructors </a></h2>

<p> Math objects can be <b>constructed</b> from other math objects by many different procedures.</p>

<ul>
<li>
The integers $1$ , $2$ and $4$ are math objects, and from them you can construct the set $\{1, 2, 4\}$.

<li>You can construct the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair">ordered pair</a> $(1, 2)$ from the numbers $1$ and $2$.</li>

<li>  From those same numbers you can construct <i>another</i> ordered pair $(2,1)$ and a bunch of ordered triples such as $(1,2,1)$.
</li>

<li>Not to mention the <i>set</i> $\{1, 2\}$ and the set of sets $\{\emptyset,\{1\},\{2\},\{1,2\}\}$, which is the <i>set of all subsets</i> of $\{1,2\}$.  It has four elements.</li>

</ul>

<h4 class=proc>In abstractmath.org, we construct math objects only out
of math objects.
</h4>


<p>In abmath, we don't (usually) talk about the set of pairs of people consisting of
husbands and wives. We don't talk about the list of American states ordered alphabetically. This
is to avoid certain philosophical complications that would be distracting and
largely irrelevant. </p>

<p>Other websites and texts <i>do</i> make constructions using math
constructors on physical objects. They are not wrong to do this. Here I am
merely wimping out on getting into the complexities they involve!

<h2>Objects, processes and relationships</h2>

<h4 class='proc'>A math object is like a physical object in that you can <i>do things to it</i>. </h4>

<ul>
<li> You
can burn a piece of wood.
</li>

<li> You
can add $77$ to itself, getting $154$.</li>

<li>You can take the derivative of the function $x^3$, getting $3x^2$.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class='proc'>You can't do most
operations to <i>every</i> object, though. </h4>
<ul>

<li>
You can burn a piece of wood but you can't burn a molecule of helium.
</li>

<li>
You can add $77$ to itself but you can't add  a triangle to itself.
</li>

<li>
You can't take the derivative of the function defined by:

\[F(x)=\left\{\begin{align}
&amp;1\,\,\,\,\,\,\text{if
}x\,\,\text{is rational} \\
&amp;0\,\,\,\,\,\,\text{if
}x\,\,\text{is irrational} \\
\end{align} \right.\]

for all real $x$
(more about that function <a
href="MMFuncExamples.htm#ratnot">here</a>).
</li>

</ul>


<h4 class='proc'>You can perform more
complicated operations involving several objects. </h4>

<ul>
<li>
You can nail a birdhouse to a tree.
</li>
<li>
You can add $42$ and $63$.
</li>

<li>
You
can calculate

  \[\int_{3}^{5}{3{{x}^{2}}\,dx=98}\]

which means applying
the process of calculating the definite integral to <i>three
objects</i>: two numbers, $3$ and $5$, and one <a href="MMFuncNotation.htm#barredarrownotation">function</a> $x\mapsto
3{{x}^{2}}$.
</li>
</ul>

<h4 class='proc'>Math objects can have various

What IS a mathematical object?

<i>I am myself and my circum&shy;stances.</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Ortega_y_Gasset#Philosophy">José Ortega y Gasset</a>.
</p>
<p> As
I said at the top of this chapter, I am not going to talk about what
math objects <i>are</i>, but <i>how you should think about them</i>.
</p>
 <h4>Example</h4>
<p>
The number $42$ is an object about
which you know a bunch of things: </p>

<ul>
<li> It
is called "42" in decimal notation and "101010" in binary notation. </li>
<li> It
is an integer.  It is also a real number.</li>
<li> It
is divisible by $2$. </li>
<li> It
is one more than $41$.</li>
<li> You
can add, subtract, multiply and divide it by other numbers.
</li>
</ul>




<p> In
other words, you know some of its <b>properties</b>, some
<b>processes</b> you can apply to it, and some <b>relationships</b> it has with other objects. <i>This is all you ever need to know about a math object. </i>  "What it is" is irrelevant. In my opinion asking "what is it?" is a meaningless question about <i>any</i> object, physical or abstract.

<h2><a name="_Toc153180903"></a><a name=otherkinds>Other kinds </a>of
non-physical objects</h2>

<h3><a name=abstractobject></a><a name="_Abstract_objects"></a>Abstract objects</h3>


<p>There are other kinds of <b>abstract objects</b> besides
math objects. I will give some examples here. But note: you can get carried
away and write <i>books</i> about abstract objects and classify them in
also sorts of ways. You may think I have got carried away a bit too much here!</p>
<ul>
<li>
"<b>September</b>" is an
abstract object with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_noun">proper
name</a>. It certainly is not a physical object. Its properties <i>change
over time</i> (sometimes "this month is September" is true and sometimes
it is false) and <i>it affects what people do</i> (some of us have to go back to
school). Neither of these is true of mathematical objects
(see <a href="MMImagesMetaphors.htm#rigorous">rigorous</a>).

</li>

<li>
A <b>schedule </b>is an abstract object. When we think about our schedule for
Wednesday afternoon, it <i>may </i>be represented as a physical piece of
handwriting, or as a bunch of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc#Physical_details">pits</a> on
our hard disk (which if we push the right buttons becomes characters for us to
read on a screen), or it may be <i>only in our mind.</i><i> </i> The
schedule is an abstract object with possible physical representations, and we
refer to it as we refer to physical objects. We say "my schedule" and "I need
to make a schedule". A schedule is not a mathematical object: <i>it  affects what people do</i>
and <i>it changes over
time.</i> </p>
</li>

<li>
 A <b>letter of the
alphabet</b>, such as "c", is an abstract object. However the letter "c" is also
associated with a certain physical shape of a mark on paper or computer
screen. Sometimes we say "c" to refer to an actual mark of that shape and
sometimes we are talking about the letter in a more abstract sense.
</li>

<li>When you write a "C" on the board, point to it, and say, "This is a C", you are referring to a particular mark.
</li>


 
<ul>
 <li>
 When you say,
"Let c denote the speed of light", you are <i>not </i> talking
about the particular physical mark you see in that sentence. What you mean is
that <i>anywhere in your discourse</i> when you say or write 'c' you
mean the speed of light.</li>

<li>
 When you say "<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_before_e_except_after_c"> i before e except after c… </a>"
are you talking about physical marks? It makes my head hurt
to think about this.

</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p class='smallind' >
 The idea of distin&shy;guishing
between abstract objects and math objects and in parti&shy;cular the schedule
example are from <a href="#Hersh"><i> What
is Mathe&shy;matics, Really?</i> </a> by Reuben
Hersh. You can find out what
philos&shy;ophers say about abstract objects starting <a
href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abstract-objects/"> here.
</p>

<h3><a name="_Fictional_objects"></a> Fictional objects </h3>


 <p class='smallind' >
I am using the word “object” in the philo&shy;soph&shy;ical sense of <i>object of thought</i>.  Such a thing can be ani&shy;mate or in&shy;ani&shy;mate.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn">unicorn</a>
is a <b>fictional object</b>. We may talk about them as if they are real physical objects,
and we think of them as having many of the properties of physical objects.</p>

<p>A unicorn has a horn in the middle of its forehead, allows only virgins to ride it,
and has cloven hooves. If you show a picture of a supposed unicorn that shows
horse-type non-split hooves to certain types of fantasy fans, they will object strongly
and say, "That's wrong! Unicorns have cloven hooves!"</p>




<p>But
what does that <b>mean</b>? Why not define unicorns any way you
want, since they are not real? Answer: For the same reason we must not define $\pi
$ to be equal to $3$: The meaning of the symbol $\pi $ and the concept of
unicorn are <i>part of our common cultur</i>e (at least the common culture of
the intersection of fantasy fans and mathematicians) and we
violate our expectations and confuse people if we use these symbols and words
with other meanings. </p>

 <p class='smallind' >
The preceding paragraph is contro&shy;versial. Many mathe&shy;maticians would say you <i>certainly</i> may define "uni&shy;corn" or to be any&shy;thing you want. Some of them <i>redefine common termi&shy;nology in math&shy;e&shy;matics books</i> they write.<span class='purple'> Those books are very confusing to read.</span>
</p>

<p> Another
type of fictional object is a <b>character in a book</b>, for example Sherlock
Holmes. The source of information we have about Sherlock Holmes is the set of
stories Arthur Conan Doyle wrote about him.</p>
<a
name=common>
<h3> What abstract and fictional objects have in common</h3>


<ul>

<li> Each
one corresponds to a physical arrangement in our brain that connects the concept to
certain properties, relationships with other objects, and expectations of
behaviors.</li>

 <li>Each
one is talked about using many of the same grammatical
constructions
as for physical objects. </li>

<li>We say "September has thirty days"
and "Darth Vader wears a ventilator" (proper nouns), and "A month has at least
28 days" and "A unicorn has cloven hooves" (common nouns). </li>

<li>This suggests that these
concepts <i>are all stored and manipulated in similar ways by the brain</i>.
</li>

</ul>

<h2><a name=foundations></a><a name="_Toc153180904"></a><a name="_Toc127938950"></a><a
name="_Do_what_they_say, not what they do"></a> Foundational aspects </h2>

<p> Sometimes, when asked about how they think
about an object, a mathematician will give a description of the object based on
some particular construction used in the study of the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_mathematics"> foundations of mathematics</a>. Such constructions are
useful for showing that some part of math is consistent if some other more
primitive part is. However, in my opinion <i>they are not usually much help in studying the particular object.</i> </p>

<h4> Example</h4>



<p>
It is common in texts on foundations to define
each kind of mathematical object as a special kinds of set. For example, the ordered pair $(a,b)$
may be defined to be the set $\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$. This has technical importance in foundations, but it is <i>totally misleading</i> to say things such as "The first coordinate of $(a,b)$ <i>is</i> $\{a\}$".</p>

 <p class='smallind' >
<a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair">Wikipedia</a> has an illumi&shy;nating
 dis&shy;cus&shy;sion of how ordered pairs have been defined.</p>

<p>

<h4>Specification for  ordered pairs</h4>
<p>All we need to know about the ordered pair $(a,b)$ is that <i>if two ordered pairs are equal, then their first coordinates are equal and their second coordinates are equal.</i> So for example, if $(a,b)=(c,d)$, then $a=c$ and $b=d$. For example, $(1,3)\neq(2,3)$ because $1\neq 2$. That is essentially the definition of "ordered pair" in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_type_theory">homotopy type theory</a>, a proposed system for providing a foundation for math other than set theory.
</p>

<h4> Example</h4>

<p>Usually, a mathematician will simply talk about the number $2$ as if it were a specific individual that we are all familiar with. That is because <i>that
is the way a mathematician thinks about it.</i></p>

<p>For purposes of foundations, the natural numbers may be defined by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms">Peano axioms</a>.  It is correct to say that in that axiom system, $2$ may be defined by saying that it is something like "the successor of the successor of $0$." Other axiom systems define $2$ in other ways. It is wrong to say that what $2$ <i>really is</i> (its "true inner essence") is the successor of the successor of $0$.
