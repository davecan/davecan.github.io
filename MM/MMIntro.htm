<h2>Who is this website for?</h2>

<p><span class=bluesmall>Abstractmath.org is designed for <span class=bluesmall>people who are beginning the study of some part of abstract math.</span> This includes:<p>


<ul>
<li><span class=bluesmall>Students</span> taking math courses that require working with abstract definitions and understanding and creating proofs.</li>


<li>
<span class=bluesmall>Teachers of university courses</span> like those just described.</li>

<li><span class=bluesmall>Professionals (in any one of many fields) who need to learn math</span> that is described in terms of mathematical properties with little or no reference to applications.</li>

<li><span class=bluesmall>Anyone who is curious about advanced math!</span></li>
</ul>

<a name="whatsab"></a>

 <h2>What is abstract math?</h2>

<p class=bluesmall>
<span class=red>Abstract math</span> is my name for what is often called “higher math” or “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_math">pure math</a>”. </p>

<ul>

<li> Abstract Math provides <span class=bluesmall>the conceptual background and theory</span> that justifies the way math is used in applications.</li>

<li>Abstract math requires <span class=bluesmall>conceptual reasoning about abstract ideas</span> (as well as manipulating symbols), in particular on <span class=bluesmall>understanding and constructing proofs</span>.</li>

<li>Abstract math is <span class=bluesmall>mathematics for its own sake</span>. In doing abstract math, you state theorems and prove them mostly in the context of mathematical ideas rather than applications or ideas from other fields.</li>

<li>When you first meet up with abstract math, you may find it <span  class=bluesmall>hard to understand or even bizarre</span>. If you need to know some piece of abstract math you may find the texts in the subject appear to be <span  class=bluesmall>unmotivated and full of mysterious chains of reasoning</span>. This happens to many
people who are quite good at solving trig, derivative and integral problems.</li>

<li>Many of the references in <a href="#othersources">Other Sources for math</a> discuss various aspects of abstract math.</li>

</ul>

<a name="overview"></a>
<h2>Overview of the site</h2>

<p class=bluesmall>This website is a multiple-entry site with many cross-links. This overview will give you a start on finding out what is on it. </p>

<h3>The four main parts of the website</a></h3>

<p>These head pages explain the ideas of each part in more detail:</p>

<p><a href="MMLangMath.htm">The languages of math</a></p>

<p><a href="MMMathReasoning.htm">Mathematical reasoning.</a></p>

<p><a href="MMUnderstandingMath.htm">Understanding math</a></p>

<p><a href="MMDoingMath.htm">Doing math</a></p>

<a name="topicarticles"></a>

<h3>Other articles</h3>

<p>Abmath also has articles on certain mathematical topics:</p>

<p><a href="MMNumbers.htm">Numbers</a></p>

<p><a href="MMSets.htm">Sets</a></p>

<p><a href="MMFunctions.htm">Functions</a></p>

<ul>
<li>These topic articles describe a few of the basic ideas of each topic. </li>

<li>They define the ideas precisely and describe how to think about
them.  </li>

<li>None of the articles go very far into the subject, but there are links to websites that cover the subjects more
thoroughly. </li></ul>

<h2>Reading this website</h2>


<h3><a name="purpleprose">Purple
prose</a></h3>

<p>Many of the important ideas about mathematics in this site are summarized in </p>

<center><table border="0">
<tr>
<td><p class='purpleprose'>
Slogans in Purple
Prose
</p></td></tr></table></center>

<ul>

<li>I put the slogans in purple prose because they are aimed at correcting <b>deep misunder&shy;standings</b> that some readers will have about certain topics. <font color="#8000A0"><b>Take purple prose statements seriously.</b></font></li>

<li>
It takes work to understand all the ins and outs of purple-prose slogans.
Many of them require thinking about things in a way that is <i>very different</i> from the way you think about things in daily life.
</li><li>
Some of them are <font color="#8000A0"><b>difficult to believe and put into practice.</b></font>
</li>

</ul>


<h3>Links</h3>

<p class=bluesmall>This website is aimed at people with widely varying knowledge of parts of math. When some sort of math object or method is mentioned, it is usually linked to a definition or explanation elsewhere in abstractmath.org or in Wikipedia.</p>

<center><table border="0">
<tr>
<td><p class=purpleprose>This website is intended to be read<br />on the screen, not on paper.<br />  
If you are not sure you understand a word<br />or phrase underlined in blue<br />I encourage you to click on it.</p></td></tr></table></center>

<p>This is <i>particularly important</i> if the word is an ordinary English word rather than a technical word such as "homomorphism", because mathematicians routinely give ordinary words technical meanings which may be quite different from their ordinary meanings. Examples: "<a href="MMDefs.htm">definition</a>" and "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_%28mathematics%29">group</a>".</p> 


<h3>Images and metaphors</h3>

<p>In many places in abmath you will find a section or an article with the phrase "<b>images and metaphors</b>" in its title. An article title "Images and metaphors for [topic]" will tell you about <i>how to think intuitively about [topic]</i>. <span class=purple>Gaining intuition about a topic in math is as important as learning how to understand and come up with proofs.</span></p> 

<p>Intuition is both vitally necessary and dangerous, since it can mislead you. The article baldly titled <a href="MMImagesMetaphors.htm">Images and Metaphors</a> explains this aspect of doing math in general, and it is worth looking at to get an overview of what is going on when you read (for example) <a href="MMImagesMetaphorsFunctions.htm">Functions: Images Metaphors and Representations</a> (big article) or <a href="MMRationalNumbers.htm#imagesmetaphorsrationals">Images and Metaphors for Rational Numbers</a> (little bitty section).</p> 

<a name="mathematicanotebooks"></a>

<a name="cdffiles"></a>

<h3>Mathematica</h3>

<p>Many of the abmath articles are illustrated by diagrams created in <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a>.</p> 

<ul>

<li>The programming for these illustrations are in Mathematica notebooks, all of which have a file extension ".nb".</li>
 
<li>The illustrations are all .gif, .jpeg or .png files.</li> 

<li>There are also links to interactive documents with extension ".cdf". </li>

</ul>

<p>All these files are in the directory <a href="Mathematica/">Mathematica</a>, many of them in subdirectories.</p> 

<h4>How to use the Mathematica files</h4>

<ul>

<li>If you own or have access to <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica 10.4</a> or later, you can load an .nb or a .cdf file into Mathematica and run the interactive commands (the ones with sliders), turn any 3D diagram to get better views, and change and run any command in any way you want. Like everything in  abstractmath.org, the files are licensed under a <a
href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 License</a>.</li>

<li>If you own <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/">CDF Player</a> (which is free), you can load an .nb or .cdf file into the player and run the interactive commands and turn 3D diagrams around to get different views. But you can't change the document or compile any command in it.</li>


</ul>
