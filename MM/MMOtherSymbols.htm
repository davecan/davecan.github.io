<h1>OTHER SYMBOLS USED IN MATH</h1>
<a name="introduction"></a>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<ul>

<li>This list includes only the major meanings of the most common symbols, according to my judgment.</li><li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mathematical_symbols">list of mathematical symbols</a> in Wikipedia includes many other symbols but does not include all, or even most of, the meanings of the symbols.</li><li>Like many other parts of abstractmath.org, in depth lexicographical research is needed (anyone have ten million dollars?) See <a href="MMAttitude.htm#usage">Remarks about usage.</a></li>

<li>More information about mathematical symbols may be found in individual entries in <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com">Mathworld</a> and in Wikipedia.</li> 
</ul>

<a name="accent"></a>
<a name="accentedcharacters"></a>

<h2>Accented characters</h2>

<p class=blue>Mathematicians frequently use an <font color="#911B1B">accent</font>
to create a new<a href="/MM/MMVarSub.htm#variable"> variable</a>
from an old one. This is usually done to denote a <a href="/MM/MMMathObj.htm">mathematical
object</a> with some specific functional relationship with the old one.</p>

<ul>

<li>The most commonly used accents <i>over</i> the letter are <a href="#arrow"><b>arrow</b></a>,
<a href="#bar"><b>bar</b></a>, <a href="#check"><b>check</b></a>, <a href="#dot"><b>dot</b></a>,
<a href="#hat"><b>hat</b></a> and
<a href="#tilde"><b>tilde</b></a>.</li>

<li><a href="#prime"><b>prime</b></a> and <a href="#star"><b>star</b></a> may be used <i>after</i> the letter as a superscript.</li>

<li><a href="#slash"><b>slash</b></a> may be used <i>across</i> a relational symbol.</li>

</ul>


<p>All of the accents except arrow and slash (as far as I know) have more than one meaning. In the list below, I mention some common meanings, but mathematicians may and
do define other meanings for the symbols.</p>

<h3><a name=arrow>Arrow</a></h3>

<ul>

<li>Expressions such as $\vec{a}$, $\vec{m}$, $\vec{v}$, $\vec{x}$ usually denote vectors.</li>


<li>A variant is $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle\rightharpoonup}{x}$. (The symbol above the $x$ is called a "harpoon").</li>

<li>In print, vectors are usually printed in boldface, for example "$\textbf{x}$", but the arrow version is easier to use at the blackboard.</li>

<li>In LaTeX, $\vec{x}$ is coded as "\vec{x}".</li>

<li>The
arrow is also used stand-alone in </i><a
href="/MM/MMFuncNotation.htm#arrownotation">arrow notation</a>.</li>

</ul>

<h3><a name=bar>Bar</a></h3>

<ul>

<li>For a variable $x$, "$\bar{x}$" is pronounced "x bar".</li>

<li>In probability and statistics, the bar may be used to denote the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean">sample mean</a> of a random variable. </li>

<li>In many branches of math, the bar may be used to denote the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(mathematics)"><b>closure</b></a> (however it is defined) of a substructure of a mathematical structure.</li>

<li>The bar is also used to denote the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate">conjugate</a> of a complex number.</li>

<li>The
typographical name of the symbol is <b>macron</b>.</li>

<li>In LaTeX, $\bar{x}$ is coded as "\bar{x}$".</li>

</ul>

<h3><a name=check>Check</a></h3>

<ul>

<li>The symbol "&#711;" over a letter is commonly pronounced "<b>check</b>"
by mathematicians. For example, $\check{c}$ is pronounced "c check".</li>

<li>The typographical name for the symbol is <b>caron</b> or <b>ha&#269;ek.</b></li>

<li>The ha&#269;ek is used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8Cech_cohomology">&#268;ech cohomology</a> and
occasionally in other fields.</li>
<li>
In LaTeX, $\check{x}$ is coded as "\check{x}" in math mode.</li>

</ul>

<h3><a name=dot>Dot</a></h3>

<ul>

<li>The expression $\dot{x}$ is pronounced "x dot".</li>

<li>In math, by far the most common use of "$\dot{x}$" is to denote the derivative of the variable $x$ with respect to time.</li>

<li>The dot is also used as a binary operator to denote multiplication, as in "$x\cdot y$", and to denote the dot product of vectors.</li>

<li>In LaTeX, $\dot{x}$ is coded as "\dot{x}", and $x\cdot y$ is coded as "x\cdot y".</li>

</ul>

<h3><a name=hat>Hat</a></h3>

<ul>

<li>The expression $\hat{x}$ is pronounced "x hat". 
</li>
<li>The hat is used to mean a very large number of different things. One that seems to me very common is to indicate the Fourier transform of a function.</li>

<li>A peculiar usage is to indicate that an item in a list is omitted.  For example, \[(x_1,x_2,x_3,\hat{x}_4,x_5)\] means \[(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_5)\] </li>

<li>The typographical name of the symbol
is <b>circumflex</b>.</li>

<li>In LaTeX, $\hat{x}$ is coded as "\hat{x}".</li>

</ul>


<h3><a name=prime>Prime</a></h3>

<ul>

<li>The symbol "$'$" is
pronounced "prime" or "dash". For example, $x'$ is pronounced "x prime" or "x
dash". $x''$ is pronounced "x double  prime". The "dash" pronunciation is
used mostly outside the United States.</li>

<li>If $f$ is a differentiable function, $f'$ usually denotes its
derivative.</li>

<li>If $x$
is a variable, $x'$, $x''$ and so on may be defined as new variables of the
same type. I have seen this usage bother beginning abstract math students, who expect it to mean the derivative.</li>

<li>The example of a proof in <a
href="/MM/MMProofPresentation.htm#detailedlook">Presentations of proofs</a>
shows the prime and double prime in use. See more about the prime symbol in <a
href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Prime.html">MathWorld</a>.</li>

</ul>

<h3><a name=slash>Slash</a></h3>

<p>A <b>slash</b> across a relational symbol means the
resulting statement is false. For example, "$x\ne y$" means that the statement "$x
= y$" is false; in other words, $x$ is not equal to $y$.</p>



<h3><a name=star>Star</a></h3>

<p>The asterisk "*" may
be used independently or as a modifier of a variable. In either case (except
when it denotes multiplication) it is pronounced "star".</p>

<h4>Star as modifier</h4>

<ul>

<li>If $a$ is a <a href="/MM/MMVarSub.htm">variable</a>, $a^\ast$ may denote the result of applying a specific <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involution_(mathematics)">involution</a> to $a$, for example the complex conjugate or the adjoint.</li>

<li>If $a$
is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing)">character</a>,
$a^\ast$ may denote any number of repetitions of the character.</li>

<li>For these uses, the LaTeX code for $a^\ast$ is "a^\ast".  Note that LaTeX also allows $a^\star$, which is typeset by "a^\star", but I don't know of examples of its use in math. </li>

</ul>

<h4>Used independently</h4>

<ul>
<li>A
"*-algebra" is an algebra with a designated involution called "*". </p>

<li>In
programming languages "*" is used to denote multiplication. More <a
href="/MM/MMFuncNotation.htm#asterisk">here</a>.</p>

<li>The <i>word
</i>"star" may be used as a mathematical adjective without being associated
with asterisks, as for example with <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_polyhedron">star polyhedra</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name=tilde>Tilde</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The symbol "~" is pronounced "tilde" (till-day or till-dee), or informally
"twiddle" or "squiggle".</li>

<li>The tilde may be placed on top of a variable, for example "$\tilde{x}$" with several possible meanings.  
</li>

<li>Before
a number the tilde is used to mean "approximately". "~42" means "approximately
42".</li>

<li>$\sim
\,,\,\,\approx \,,\,\,\simeq \,,\,\,\cong$ are all used to denote binary
relations. More about this <a href="#equivalences">below</a>. </li>

<li>Other uses are discussed in <a
href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Tilde.html">MathWorld</a>.</li>

<li>In LaTeX, you code $\tilde{x}$ as "\tilde{x}" and $x\sim y$ as "x\sim y".</li>

</ul>

<a name="quantifiers"></a>


<h2>Quantifiers</h2>

<p class=blue>Quantifier symbols are used in logic.</p>

<ul>
<li>$\forall $ is the <b>universal quantifier</b>. Discussed in the article <a href="/MM/MMUnivTrue.htm#forallsymbol">Universally True</a>.</li>

<li>$\exists $ is the <b>existential quantifier</b>. Discussed in the article <a href="/MM/MMExistenceStatements.htm">Existential statements.</a></li>

</ul>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<ul>
<li>Many mathematicians use the symbols "$\forall$" and "$\exists$"
at the blackboard as abbreviations.</li>

<li>Except in books and papers on logic, it is
not common to see them in printed texts. </li></ul>

<h3>Pronunciation</h3>

<p>Pronouncing expressions using the two quantifiers involves a
<i>difference in English syntax</i>.</p>

<ul>

<li> $\forall
n\,(n\text{ is even)}$ is pronounced "For all $n$, $n$ is even."</li>

<li> $\exists
n\,(n\text{ is even)}$ is pronounced "There is an $n$ such that $n$ is even."</li>

<li>In LaTeX you code "$\forall$" as "\forall" and "$\exists$" as "\exists".
</li>

<li>See also the articles on
notation for <a href="/MM/MMAndOrNot.htm#symnotconn">connectives</a>
and <a href="/MM/MMAndOrNot.htm#negation">negation</a>.</li>

</ul>

<a name=equivalences>

<h2>Equivalences</h2>

<p class=blue>The symbols $=,\,\,:=\,\,\equiv ,\,\,\sim ,\,\,\approx$ and $\cong$, along with many less common symbols, all denote relations concerned with approximate or exact equivalence. </p>

<ul>

<li>"$:=$" has a unique meaning.</li> <li>"$=$" has a unique meaning in math, but not in computing.</li> <li>Each of the others have at least two common meanings.</li>  <li>There are many other symbols denoting some form of equivalence as well. You can find them in Wikipedia's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mathematical_symbols">list of mathematical symbols.</a></li>

</ul>

<br />

<a name="equals"></a>

<h3 class=symbol>$\boldsymbol{=}$</h3>

<ul>
<li>The <b>equals sign</b> "=" has a standard meaning in math: "<i>x = y</i>"
means <i>x</i> and <i>y </i>are two different names for the same <a
href="/MM/MMMathObj.htm">mathematical object</a>. </li>

<li>In some programming languages, "$=$" is an <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_(computer_science)">assignment
operator.</a> In such a language, the statement "$x=42$" means that the variable $x$ now has the value $42$ (the same as saying "Let $x=42$"). Many such languages use "$==$" for the mathematical meaning of the equals sign.</li>

<li>An expression containing an equals sign may have various <a
href="/MM/MMIntent.htm">intents</a>, and determining those intents is something students must learn how to do.
</li>

<li>For more information, see <a
href="/MM/MMGlossary.htm#equals">equation</a> in the Glossary, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation">equation,</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equals_sign">equal sign,</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Equality_(mathematics)">equality</a> in Wikipedia, and the article <a href="http://www.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/preprints/when_is_one.pdf">When is one thing equal to some other thing?</a> by Barry Mazur.</li>
</ul>

<a name="colonequals"></a>

<h3 class=symbol>$\boldsymbol{:=}$</h3>

<ul>
<li>This symbol is called <a name=colonequals><b>colon
equals</b></a>.</li>  

<li>It means
means "is defined to be". For example, "$f(x):={{x}^{2}}+1$" means that $f(x)$ is defined to be ${{x}^{2}}+1$ and "$A:=\{1\,,\,3\,,\,5\,,\,6\}$" means that $A$ is defined to be the set $\{1,3,5,6\}$.</li> 

<li>The <a href="MMVarMeanings.htm#scope">scope</a> of definitions given this
way are usually small, for example the current paragraph or section.</li>

<li>This usage originated in computing science and now many mathematicians use it.</li>

<li>Two other symbols are also used to mean "is defined as", illustrated by "$x\equiv42$" and "$x{\overset{\text{def}}{=}}42$".</li>

</ul>

<a name="equivalence"></a>

<h3 class=symbol>$\boldsymbol{\equiv}$</h3>

<ul>

<li>The symbol "$\equiv$" most commonly denotes  a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_relation">modular congruence</a> or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_(geometry)">geometric congruence.</a> Note that the symbol "$\cong$" is also commonly used for these meanings.</li>

<li>The Wikipedia article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_bar">Triple bar</a> describes other less common meanings of this symbol.</li>

<li>I have never heard a mathematician use the name "Triple bar".</li>

<li>In LaTeX, "$\equiv$" is coded as "\equiv".</li>
</ul>

<h3 class=symbol>$\boldsymbol{\sim}$</h3>

<ul>

<li>"$\sim$" used between two math expressions is called the <b>tilde operator</b>.</li>

<li>For functions $f$ and $g$, the statement "$f\sim g$" means that $f$ is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_analysis">asymptotic</a> to $g$.</li>

<li>"$\sim$" is one of many symbols, listed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation">Wikipedia article on approximation,</a> used to indicate that one number is approximately equal to another. Note that "approximately equal" is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexive_relation">reflexive</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_relation">symmetric</a> but not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation">transitive.</a></li> 

<li>"$\sim$" is one of many symbols used in logic to indicate <a href="/MM/MMAndOrNot.htm#andornotsymbolic">negation.</a></li>
</ul>


<h3 class=symbol>$\boldsymbol{\approx}$</h3>

<ul>

<li>For numbers $x$ and $y$, the statement "$x \approx y$" means that $x$ is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation">approximation</a> to $y$.</li> 

<li>For functions $f$ and $g$, the statement "$f \approx g$" means that $f$ and $g$ are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_analysis">asymptotic.</a></li>

<li>In LaTeX, "$\approx$" is encoded as "\approx".</li>

</ul>

<a name="congruence"></a>

<h3 class=symbol>$\boldsymbol{\cong}$</h3>

<ul>

<li>The symbol "$\cong$" may denote that two math objects are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism">isomorphic,</a> a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_relation">modular congruence</a> or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_(geometry)">geometric congruence.</a> These are all equivalence relations.</li> 

<li>The symbol may be used with other meanings, including "approximately equal to".</a></li>

<li>In LaTeX, "$\cong$" is coded as "\cong".</li>

</ul>

<a name="inclusions"></a>

<a name="inclusion"></a>

<h2>Inclusions</h2>

<p class=blue>The symbols $\subset
\,,\supset \,,\subseteq \,,\supseteq \,,\varsubsetneq \text{, and}\varsupsetneq $, along with some less common symbols, all denote relations concerned with inclusion.</p>

<h3 class=symbol>$\boldsymbol{\subseteq}$</h3>

<ul>

<li>"$A\subseteq B$" means that every element of $A$ is an element of $B$. This can be worded as:</li> 
<ul>

<li>$A$ is <b>included in</b> $B$, or
</li>
<li>$A$ is a <a href="/MM/MMSetSubset.htm"><b>subset</b></a> of
$B$.</li>

</ul>

<li>The LaTeX code for "$\subseteq$" is "\subseteq".</li>

 
</ul>
<a name="twomeaningsinclusion"></a>
<p class=smallind>"$A\subseteq B$" specifically includes the possibility that $A = B$. Note that that is the standard meaning of "subset": "$A$ is a subset of $B$" <i>always allows $A=B$ and always allows $A$ to be the empty set.</i></p>



<h3 class=symbol>$\boldsymbol{\subset}$</h3>

<ul>

<li>The statement "$A\subset B$" has <i>two meanings</i> in math writing and, at
least in the research literature, authors are <i>not likely tell you which one
they are using.</i></li>

<ul>

<li>"$A\subset B$" may
mean exactly the same thing as "$A\subseteq B$", including
the possibility that $A = B$. This meaning is very
common in research papers and it occurs sometimes in textbooks too.</li>

<li>"$A\subset B$" may
mean $A\subseteq B$ but $A\ne B$, in analogy with "$\le$" and "$\lt$". This meaning is
common in textbooks and seems to be universal in high school math texts.</li>

</ul>

<p class=purpleprose>When you see "$A\subset
B$",<br />make sure you know what the author means.</p>

<li>The LaTeX code for "$\subset$" is "\subset".</li>

</ul>

<h3 class=symbol>$\boldsymbol{\supset}$</h3>

<ul>
<li>"$B\supset A$" means $A\subset B$ in <i>either</i> of its meanings.</li>

<li>It is pronounced "$B$ includes $A$" or "$B$ is a superset of $A$".</li>

<li>When $A$
and $B$ are statements (not sets) $B\supset A$ may mean "If $B$, then $A$". See the abmath article on <a href="/MM/MMConditional.htm#horseshoe">Conditional assertions</a>.</li>

<li>The LaTeX code for "$\supset$" is "\supset".</li>

</ul>

<h3 class=symbol>$\boldsymbol{\supseteq}$</h3>
<ul>
<li>$B\supseteq
A$ means $A\subseteq B$.</li>

<li>This can be phrased as "$B$ <b>includes</b> $A$" or "$B$ is a <b>superset</b> of $A$".</li> 

<li>The LaTeX code for "$\supseteq$" is "\supseteq".</li>

</ul>

<h3 class=symbol>$\boldsymbol{\varsubsetneq}$</h3>

<ul>
<li>"$A\varsubsetneq B$" means that every element of $A$ is an element of $B$ and there is an element of $B$ that is not an element of $A$.

<li>This symbol thus means the same thing as one of the two meanings of "$\subset$", and in my opinion should be more widely used.</li>

<li>The LaTeX code for "$\varsubsetneq$" is "\varsubsetneq".</li>

</ul>
<a name="miscellaneoussymbols"></a>

<h2>Miscellaneous symbols</h2>

<h3 class=symbol>$\boldsymbol{\times}$</h3>

<ul>
<li>"$a\times b$" can mean the product of numbers $a$ and $b$,
the product of matrices, the cartesian or categorical product of mathematical objects, or
the vector product of 3-dimensional vectors. There is more information about this symbol in the article <a href="MMMoreLanguage.htm#overloadednotation">overloaded notation</a>.</li>

<li>The product of numbers or matrices can also be represented by juxtaposition ("$ab$" instead of "$a\times b$") or (in Mathematica) by a space, but that is not true of the cartesian product or the vector product.</li>

<li>The LaTeX code for "$\times$" is "\times".</li>
</ul>

<a name=element>
<h3 class=symbol>$\boldsymbol{\in}$</h3>

<ul>

<li>The
phrase "$x\in S$" means $x$ is an element of the set $S$.</li>

<li>Some mathematicians write this symbol as $\varepsilon $ (one form of the
Greek letter <a href="/MM/MMAlphabets.htm#epsilon">epsilon.</a>)
Sometimes they even call it "epsilon", but it is really intended to be a
different symbol.</li>

<li>The LaTeX code for "$\in$" is "\in".</li>

</ul>

<a name="emptyset"></a>
<a name="zero"></a>
<h3 class=symbol>$\boldsymbol{\varnothing}$</h3>



<ul>

<li>The symbol "$\varnothing$" denoted the <a href="MMSetSpecific.htm#emptyset">empty set.</a></li>

<li>Another symbol used for the empty set is "$\emptyset$".</li>

<li>Computer people often use "$\emptyset$" to denote zero, in order to distinguish it from "$0$".  This leads some computing science students to think that the empty set <i>is</i> zero (I speak from repeated personal experience.)</li>

<li>Some approaches to the foundations of mathematics <i>define</i> the number $0$ to be the empty set, but it is <i>entirely wrong</i> to think of $0$ and the empty set as the same.  That is a <b>violation of type</b>.  The empty set is a particular <i>set</i> and $0$ is a particular <i>number.</i>  See the Wikipedia articles on <a href="">type theory</a> and on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system">type systems.</a></li>

<li>The symbol
"$\varnothing $" is not the Greek letter phi, written $\phi $. (You
will occasionally hear mathematicians refer to the empty set as "phi", which is
historically incorrect).</li>

<li>The LaTeX code for "$\varnothing$" is "\varnothing". </li>
