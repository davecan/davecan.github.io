 <h1>VARIABLE MATHEMATICAL OBJECTS</h1>

<p class=blue>In many mathematical texts, the variable $x$ may denote a <a href="MMRealNumbers.htm">real number</a>, although which real number may not be specified. This is an example of a <font color="#911B1B">variable mathematical object</font>. This point of view and terminology is not widespread, but I think it is worth understanding because it provides a deeper understanding of some aspects about how math is done.</p> 


 
<h2> Specific and <a name=variablemathobject>variable</a> mathematical
objects </h2>



<p><a
name=varmaob></a>
It is useful to distinguish between <a
name=specificmathematicalobject><b> specific </b></a> math objects and <b> variable </b> math objects.</p> 

<h4>Examples of specific math objects</h4>

<ul>

<li>The number $42$ (the math object represented as "42" in base $10$, "2A" in hexadecimal and "XLII" as a Roman numeral) is a <b>specific</b> <a href="/MM/MMMathObj.htm">math object</a>. <span class=purple>It is not any of the representations just listed</span> -- they are just strings of letters and numbers.</li>

<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair">ordered pair</a> $(4,3)$ is a specific math object. It is not the same as the ordered pair $(7,-2)$, which is <i>another</i> specific math object.</li>

<li>The sine function $\sin:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is a specific math object. You may know that the sine function is also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine">defined for all complex numbers</a>, which gives <i>another</i> specific math object $\sin:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$.</li>

<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)#Second_example:_a_symmetry_group">group of symmetries of a square</a> is a specific math object. (If you don't know much about groups, the link gives a detailed description of this particular group.)</li>

</ul>

<h4>Variable math objects</h4>

<p>Math books are full of references to math objects, typically named by a letter or a name, that are <span class=purple>not completely specified.</span> Some mathematicians call these <b>variable objects</b> (not standard terminology). The idea of a variable mathe&shy;mati&shy;cal object is not often taught as such in under&shy;graduate classes but it is worth pondering. It has certainly clari&shy;fied <i>my</i> thinking about expres&shy;sions with variables.
</p>


<h4>Examples</h4>
<ul>
 <li>If an author or lecturer says
"Let $x$ be a real variable", you can then think of $x$ as a<b>
variable real number</b>. In a proof you can't assume that $x$ is any <i>particular</i> real number such as $42$ or $\pi$.</li>

<li>If a lecturer says, "Let $(a,b)$ be an ordered pair of integers", then all you know is that $a$ and $b$ are integers. This makes $(a,b)$ a <b>variable ordered pair</b>, specifically a pair of integers. The lecturer will not say it is a variable ordered pair since that terminology is not widely used. You have to understand that the phrase "Let $(a,b)$ be an ordered pair of integers" <span class=purple><i>implies</i> that it is a variable ordered pair just because "a" and "b" are letters instead of numbers</span>.</li> 

<li>If you are going to prove a theorem about functions, you
might begin, &quot;Let $f$ be a continuous function&quot;, and in the
proof refer to $f$ and various objects connected to $f$. This
makes $f$ a <b>variable mathematical object</b>. When you are
proving things about $f$ you may use the fact that it is continuous. But you
cannot assume that it is (for example) the sine function or any other
<i>particular</i> function.<a name="_Toc108064451"></a></p>
</li>

<li>If someone says, "Let $G$ be a group" you can
think of $G$ as a <b>variable group</b>. If you want to prove something about $G$ you are free to use the <a href="/MM/MMDefs.htm">definition</a> of "group" and any theorems you know of that apply to all groups, but you can't assume that $G$ is any specific group.
</li>

</ul>

<h4><h4>Terminology</h4></h4>

<p class>A logician would refer to the symbol $f$, thought of as denoting a function, as a <b>vari&shy;able</b>, and likewise the symbol $G$, thought of as denoting a group. But mathe&shy;maticians in general would not use the word "vari&shy;able" in those situa&shy;tions.</p>

<h2>How to think about variable objects</h2>

<p class=blue>The idea that $x$ is a variable object means thinking of $x$ as a genuine mathematical object, but with limitations about what you can say or think about it. Specifically,</p>

<p class=purpleprose>Some assertions about a variable math object<br />may be neither true nor false.</p>

<h5>Example</h5>

<p>The statement, "Let $x$ be a real
number" means that $x$ is to be regarded as a <b>variable real number</b> (usually called a "real variable"). Then you know the following facts:
</p>

<ul>

<li>The statement "${{x}^{2}}$ is
not negative" is <i>true</i>.</li>

<li>The assertion "$x=x+1$"
is <i>false.</i></li>

<li>The assertion "$x\gt 0$" is <i>neither true nor
false.</i></li>

</ul>


<h5>Example</h5>

<p>Suppose you are told that $x$ is a real number and that ${{x}^{2}}-5x=-6$.</p> 

<ul>

<li>You know (because it is given) that the statement "${{x}^{2}}-5x=-6$" is <i>true</i>.</li>

<li>By doing some algebra, you can discover that the statement "$x=2$ or $x=3$" is <i>true</i>.</li>

<li>The statement "$x=2$ <i>and</i> $x=3$" is <i>false</i>, because $2\neq3$.</li>

<li>The statement "$x=2$" is <i>neither true nor false</i>, and similarly for "$x=3$".</li>

<li>This situation could be described this way: <span class=bluesmall>$x$ is a variable real number varying over the set $\{2,3\}$</span>.</li>

</ul>



<h5>Example</h5>
<p>This example may not be easy to understand. It is intended to raise your consciousness.</p>

<p class=bluesmall>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_prime">prime pair</a> is an ordered pair of integers $(n,n+2)$ with the property that both $n$ and $n+2$ are prime numbers.</p>

<p class=bluesmall>Definition: $S$ is a <font color="#911B1B">PP set</font> if $S$ is a set of pairs of integers with the property that every pair is a prime pair.</p>


<ul>

<li>"$\{(3,5),(11,13)\}$ is a PP set" is <i>true</i>.</li>

<li>"$\{(5,7),(111,113),(149,151)\}$ is a PP set" is <i>false</i>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Now suppose $SS$ is a <b>variable PP set</b>.</p>

<ul>

<li>"$SS$ is a set" is <b>true</b> by definition.</li>

<li>"$SS$ contains $(7,9)$" is <b>false</b>.</li>

<li>"$SS$ contains $(3,5)$" is <b>neither true nor false</b>, as the examples just above show.</li>

<li>"$SS$ is an infinite set": 

<ul>

<li>This is certainly not true (see finite examples above). </li>

<li><span class=purple>This claim may be neither true nor false, or it may be plain false,</span> because no one knows whether there is an infinite number of prime pairs. </li>

<li>The point of this example is to show that <span class=purple>"we don't know" doesn't mean the same thing as "neither true nor false".</span></li>

</ul></ul>
