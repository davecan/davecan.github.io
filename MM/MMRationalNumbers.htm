<h1>RATIONAL NUMBERS</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p class=blue>A <span class=red>rational number</span> is a number that can be represented as a fraction $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are <a href="MMIntegers.htm">integers</a> and $n\ne 0$.</p>

<h3>Terminology</h3>

<p>Rational numbers may be referred to as “rationals”.  The name comes from the fact that they represent <b>ratios</b>. It is not related to the meaning
“able to reason” or “sane”.</p>

<h5>Examples</h5>

<ul>
<li>The numbers $3/4$ and $–11/5$ are rational.</li>

<li>$6$ is rational because $6 = 6/1$. In fact, <i>any</i> integer is a rational number by the same reasoning.</li>

<li>$0.33$ is rational because $0.33=33/100$.</li>

</ul>

<p class=smallind>Note that $0.33\neq1/3$. See <a href="MMRealDecimalRep.htm#approximation">Approximations.</a></p>

<h2>Representations of rational
numbers</h2>

<p class=blue>Rational numbers have two familiar <a href="MMRepsModels.htm">representations,</a> as <span class=red>fractions</span>
and as <span class=red>decimals</span>.</p>

<p class=smallind>Decimals are discussed
in the section on <a href="MMRealNumbers.htm">real numbers.</a></p>

<p>The definition of rational number says that it must be a number that <i>can be represented</i> as  a fraction of integers.

<ul>

<li>“<i>Can be</i> represented” does not mean “<i>is</i> represented”! </p>

<li>The number $0.25$ is a rational number because it <i>can
be represented</i> as $1/4$, but the expression “$0.25$” is not
itself a fraction representation.</li>

<li>An expression "$a/b$" does not automatically <a href="MMGlossary.htm#denote">denote</a> a rational number. You must check that $a$ and $b$ are <i>integers.</i></p>

<li>For example if you see the expression $\pi/e$, you cannot conclude that it denotes a rational number, because $\pi$ and $e$
are not integers.</li>

</ul>

<a name="propertiesofthefractionrepresentation"></a>
<h3>Properties of the fraction representation</h3>

<h4>Non-uniqueness</h4>

<p><b>The <a href="MMRepsModels.htm">representation</a> of a rational number as a
fraction is not unique</b>. For example,\[\frac{3}{4}=\frac{6}{8}=\frac{-9}{-12}\]

<p>Two representations $m/n$ and $r/s$
<a href="MMGlossary.htm#denote">denote</a> the same rational number <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if">if and only if</a> $ms=nr$.</p>

<h5>Example</h5>

<p>$3/4=6/8$ because $3\cdot 8=6\cdot 4$.</p>

<a name="lowestterms"></a>
<h4>Lowest terms</h4>

<p>Let $m/n$ be the representation of a rational number with $m\ne
0$ and $n\gt0$. The representation is in <b>lowest terms</b>
(or is <b>reduced)</b> if there is no integer $d\gt1$ for which $d$ divides $m$ and $d$ divides
$n$.  (See <a href="MMMoreLanguage.htm#parentheticassertion">parenthetic
assertion</a>.)</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>

<p>The symbols $3/4$ and $6/8$ are <i>two different representations of
the same number.</i>  One of the representations, $3/4$, is in lowest terms and the other is
not. So when someone says “$3/4$ is in lowest terms”, the symbol
“$3/4$” refers to the <i>representation,</i> not the rational
number. See <a href="MMMoreLanguage.htm#contextsensitive">Context-sensitive interpretation.</a></p>

<h5>Examples</h5>

<ul>

<li>$3/4$ is in <b>lowest terms,</b> but $6/8$
is not, because $6$ and $8$ have $2$ as a common divisor.</li>

<li>$74/111$ is not in
lowest terms because $74$ and $111$ have $37$ as a common divisor.  In fact, $74/111 =
2/3$.</li>

</ul>

<p>Every nonzero rational number has a representation
in lowest terms. (To get it, divide out the largest integer that divides both numerator and denominatos.)</p>

<a name="closurepropertiesofrationals"></a>

<h2>Closure properties of rationals</h2>

<p class=blue>Rational numbers are closed under addition, subtraction,
multiplication, as well as division by a nonzero rational.</p>

<p>These operations are carried out according to the familiar
rules for operating with fractions. For any two rational numbers $a/b$
and $c/d$, the values of the operations are given by these rules:
\[\frac{a}{b}\times
\frac{c}{d}=\frac{ac}{bd},\,\,\,   \frac{a}{b}+\frac{c}{d}=\frac{ad+bc}{bd} 
\text{ and } \frac{a}{b}\div \frac{c}{d}=\frac{ad}{bc}\,\,\,\,\,\,\text{(AMD)}\]</p>            
<p>The expressions $ac/bd$, $(ad+bc)/bd$, and $ad/bc$
<a href="MMGlossary.htm#denote">denote</a> rational numbers because integers are closed under addition and
multiplication, so that $ac$, $bd$, $ad$,$bc$ and $ad+bc$ are all integers.</p>

<p>If</b>  “$a/b$” and “$c/d$” are in lowest terms,
“$ac/bd$” and “$(ad+bc)/bd$”
may nevertheless not be in lowest terms. For example, the formulas give</p>
\[\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}=\frac{8}{16}\]
and \[\frac{2}{3}\times \frac{3}{4}=\frac{6}{12}\]</p>

<p>In other words, <b>“being in lowest
terms” is not closed under addition and multiplication</b>.</p>

<a name="imagesmetaphorsrationals"></a>

<h2>Images and metaphors for the
rationals</h2>

<h3>Ratios</h3>

<p>Suppose we have a line segment $L$ that is $5/8$ of a
unit long.  Then we can take a line segment $M$ that is $1$ unit long and
divide it into exactly $8$ segments of length $1/8$ unit each, and we can
divide $L$ into exactly $5$ segments of length $1/8$ unit each.  That
is because the ratio of $L$ to $M$ is $5:8$. This is the sense 
in which <b>rational
numbers represent ratios of integers.</b></p>

<p class=smallind>Remarkably, we <i>cannot</i> take a line of length $1$ and a line of length $\sqrt{2}$ and divide them into whole numbers of segments of the same length, <i>no matter how small we make the segments.</i>  This means that <b>$\sqrt{2}$ is not a rational number.</b>  This is discussed in the Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number">irrational numbers.</a></p>

<a name="density"><a name="densityoftherationalnumbers"></a>
<h3>Density of the rational numbers</h3>

<p>The integers can be thought of as beads or points in a row
going to infinity in both directions.  The rational numbers go to infinity in both
directions, too, but:</p>

<p class=purpleprose>You must not think of the rational numbers as a
row of points.</p>

<p>That is because: <b>between any two distinct rational numbers there is
another one.</b> Specifically: <b>If $r$ and $s$ are any distinct
rational numbers, then $\frac{r+s}{2}$ is a rational number between them.</b> 
This number $\frac{r+s}{2}$ is the <b>average</b> 
of $r$ and $s$, so it makes sense that it is between them. (There is a formal proof of this in the <a href="MMGlossary.htm#withoutlossofgenerality">Glossary</a>.) For example, you can check 
that if $r=\frac{5}{12}$and $s=\frac{1}{2}$, then $\frac{r+s}{2}=\frac{11}{24}$. Note that $r=\frac{10}{24}$ and $s=\frac{12}{24}$.</p>



<h4>Infinitely many between any two</h4>

<p>Observe that $\frac{r+s}{2}$
is not the <i>only</i> rational number between $r$ and $s$.  In fact, between any two distinct rational numbers there are <span class=bluesmall>infinitely
many other rational numbers</span>, because the fact that there is a rational number between <i>any</i> two distinct rational numbers means there is a rational number $t$ between $r$ and $\frac{r+s}{2}$, a rational number $u$ between $r$ and $t$, a rational number $v$ between $r$ and $u$, and so on forever.</p>

<p class=smallind>There are in fact <b>uncountably</b> many rational numbers between any two distinct rational numbers, although the argument I just gave does not prove that.</p>

<p>This means that if you are given a rational number $r$, then there is <i>no “next
largest” rational number</i> (or next smallest, either). <span class=purple>That is the sense in which the set of rational numbers is not a row of points.</span></p>

<p>The same argument shows that the set of all real numbers is also dense.</p>
