<h1>IMAGES AND METAPHORS</h1>

<p class=blue>In this chapter, I say something about <font color="#911B1B">mental represen&shy;tations</font> (metaphors and images) in general, and provide examples of how metaphors and images help us understand math –<i> and</i> how they can confuse us.</p>

<p class=blue>Pay
special attention to the section called <a
href="#twolevels">two levels</a>!  The distinction made there is vital but is often not made explicit.</p>

<p class=blue>Besides mental represen&shy;tations, there are other kinds of represen&shy;tations used in
math, discussed in the chapter on <a href="MMRepsModels.htm">represen&shy;tations and models</a>.</p>

<h2>Images and metaphors in general</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>We think and talk about our experiences of the world in terms of <b>images</b> and <b>metaphors</b> that are ultimately derived from immediate physical experience.  They are <b>mental represen&shy;tations</b>
of our experiences.</p>



<img width=173.3 height=150 src="Mathematica/JPEG/MetImages/image001.jpg"
align=right hspace=12>

<h3>Examples</h3>


<h4>Images</h4>
<p>We know what a <b>pyramid</b> looks like.  But when we refer to the <b>government’s food pyramid</b> we are not talking about actual food piled up to make a pyramid.  We are talking about a <b>visual image</b> of the pyramid.    
</p>


<h4>Metaphors</h4>
<p>We know by direct physical experience what it
means to be <b>warm</b> or <b>cold</b>.  We use these words as <a href="#_More_about_metaphors">metaphors</a>
in many ways:  </p>

<ul>
<li> We
refer to a person as having a warm or cold personality.  This has nothing to do
with their body temperature.</li>

<li>When
someone is on a treasure hunt we may tell them they are “getting warm”, even if
they are hunting outside in the snow.</li>


<li>
Children don’t always sort meta&shy;phors out correctly. Father:  “We are all going to fly to Saint Paul to see your cousin Petunia.” Child:  “But Dad, I don’t know how to fly!”
</li>
</ul>

<h3> Other terminology</h3>

<ul>
<li>My use of the word "image" means <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_image">mental image.</a>  In the study of literature, the word “image” is used in a more general way, to refer to an <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagery_(literature)">expression that evokes a mental image.</a>.</li>

<li>I use "metaphor" in the sense of <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_metaphor">conceptual metaphor.</a> The word <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor">metaphor in literary studies</a> is related to my use but is defined in terms of how it is expressed.
</li>

<li>The metaphors mentioned above involving “warm” and “cold”
evoke a sensory experience, and so could be called an image as well.  </li>

<li>In math education, the phrase <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_image_and_concept_definition">concept image</a> means the mental
structure associated with a concept, so there may be no direct connection with
sensory experience.  </li>

<li>In abstractmath.org, I use the phrase <b>metaphors
and images</b> to talk about all our mental represen&shy;tations, without trying for
fine distinctions.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Mental represen&shy;tations are <font color="#911B1B">imperfect</font></h3>

<p>One basic fact about metaphors and images is
that they apply <i>only to certain aspects of the situation.</i></p>

<ul>

<li>When someone is getting physically warm we would expect them to start sweating.</li>

<li>But if they are getting warm in a treasure hunt we <i>don’t</i> expect them to start sweating. </li> 

<li>We don’t expect the food pyramid to have a pharaoh
buried underneath it, either.</li>

</ul>

<p>Our brains handle these aspects of mental
represen&shy;tations easily and usually without our being conscious of them.  They
are <i>one of the <b>primary ways we understand the world</b>.</i></p>

<h2>Images and metaphors in math</h2>


<h3> Types of represen&shy;tations</h3>


<p>Mathe&shy;maticians who work with a particular kind
of <a href="MMMathObj.htm">mathe&shy;matical object</a>
have <b>mental represen&shy;tations</b> of that type of object that help them
understand it.  These mental represen&shy;tations come in many forms.  Most of them fit into one of the types below, but <i>the list shouldn't be taken too seriously</i>:  Some represen&shy;tations fit more that of these types, and some may not fit into any of them except awkwardly. </p>
<ul>

<li><a href="#visualimage">Visual</a></li>
<li><a href="#Notation">Notation</a></li>
<li><a href="#kinetic">Kinetic</a></li>
<li><a href="#process">Process</a></li>
<li><a href="#object">Object</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All mental represen&shy;tations are conceptual metaphors.
Metaphors are treated in detail in this chapter and in the chapter on <a
href="MMImagesMetaphorsFunctions.htm">images and
metaphors for function<i>s</i></a>.  See also <a
href="MMDysfunctional.htm#literalism">literalism</a>
and 
<a
href="/Word%20Press/?p=123">Proofs without dry bones</a> on Gyre&amp;Gimble.</p>

<p>Below I list some examples.  Many of them refer to the <b>arch function,</b>  the function defined by  $h(t):=25-{{(t-5)}^{2}}$. 
</p>


<a name="visualimage"></a>
<h3>Visual image</h3>


<h4>Geometric figures</h4>
<center>
<img width=200 height=50 src="Mathematica/JPEG/MetImages/Square Circle.jpg">
</center>
<ul>

<li>Most people (even non-mathe&shy;maticians!) can easily form a mental image of a <b>square</b> or a <b>circle</b>.</li> 

<li>Many people can also <b>draw</b> a reasonable approximation of a square or a circle, and in my opinion if you can draw it, you have a mental image of it.</li>
<a name=archalmost></a><a name="archfunction">
<li>Perhaps you would say you have a good mental image of a <b>triangle</b> and could draw one easily.  But that is a very different task from the case of squares and circles.  <font color="#8000FF"><b>Think about that.</b></font></li>
</ul>


<p><img
width=139 height=311 src="Mathematica/JPEG/MetImages/MetImages parabola.jpg" align=right></p>

<a name="archfunction"></a>

<h4>The arch function</h4>
<ul>

<li>You can picture the arch function in terms of its <b>graph</b>, which is a <a
href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola">parabola</a>.    
This visualization suggests that the function has a single maximum point that appears to occur at $t=5$.  That is an example of how metaphors can suggest (but not prove) theorems.</li>

<li>You can think of the arch function
more physically, as like the <a
href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Gateway_Arch_edit1.jpg">Gateway Arch</a>. This metaphor is suggested by the graph.</li>

</ul>

 
<h4>Interior of a shape</h4>  

<ul>

<li>The <b>interior</b> of a <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_curve#Topology">closed curve</a> or a <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere">sphere</a> is called that because it is like the interior in the everyday sense of a bucket or a house.</li>

<li>Sometimes, the interior can be described using analytic geometry.  For example, the interior of the circle $x^2+y^2=1$ is the set of points \[\{(x,y)|x^2+y^2\lt1\}\]
</li>

<li>But the "interior"  metaphor is <i>imperfect</i>: The boundary of a real-life container such as a bucket has <i>thickness</i>,
in contrast to the boundary of a closed curve or a sphere. </li> 

<li>This observation illustrates my description of a metaphor as identifying <i>part</i> of one situation with part of another. One aspect is emphasized; another aspect,
where they may differ, is ignored.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Real number line</h4>
<ul><li>You may
think of the <a href="MMRealNumbers.htm">real
numbers</a> as lying along a straight line (the <a
href="MMRealNumbers.htm#realline"> real line</a>) that extends
infinitely far in both directions.  This is both visual and a metaphor (a real
number “is” a place on the real line).</li>


<li>This metaphor is imperfect because you can't draw the <i>whole</i> real line, but only part of it.  But you can't draw the whole graph of the curve $y=25-(t-5)^2$, either.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Continuous functions</h4>

<h5>No gaps</h5>
<p>“Continuous
functions<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"> don’t have gaps in the graph</a>”.   
This is a visual image, and it is usually OK.</p>

<p>But consider the curve defined by $y=25-(t-5)^2$ for every real $x$ except $x=1$.  It is not defined at $x=1$ (and so the function is discontinuous there) but its graph looks <i>exactly like</i> the graph in <a href="#archalmost">the figure above</a> because <i>no matter how much you magnify it you can't see the gap</i>. </p>

<p><b><font color="#911B1B">So is there a gap or not?</font></b></p>

<p class='smallind'>
This is a typical math example that teachers make up to raise your consciousness.</p>


<h5>No lifting</h5>

<p>"Continuous functions can be drawn without lifting the chalk."  This is true in most familiar cases (provided you draw the graph only on a finite interval).  But consider the graph of the function defined by  $f(0)=0$ and \[f(t)=t\sin\frac{1}{t}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (0\lt t\lt 0.16)\]
(see <a href="MMFuncExamples.htm#split">Split Definition</a>).  This curve is continuous and is <i>infinitely long</i> even though it is defined on a finite interval, so you can't draw it with a chalk at all, picking up the chalk or not.  Note that it has no gaps.</p>
<br />
<p><img src="Mathematica/JPEG/MetImages/InfArcLength.jpg" align=middle></p>


</ul>
</p>
<br />

<h4>Keeping concepts separate by using mental "space"</h4>
<p>I personally use visual images to remember relationships
between abstract objects, as well.  For example, if I think of three groups,
two of which are isomorphic (for example $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ and $\text{Alt}_3$),
I picture them as in three different places in my head with a connection between the two
isomorphic ones.</p>

<a name="Notation"></a><a name="notation"></a>

<h3>Notation</h4>
<p>Here I give some examples of thinking of math objects in terms of the notation used to name them.  There is much more about notation as mathe&shy;matical represen&shy;tation in these  sections of abmath:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="/MM/MMRepsModels.htm#integers">Represen&shy;tations and models</a></li>

<li><a href="/MM/MMNaturalNumbers.htm#representationofnaturalnumbers">Representation of natural numbers</a></li>

<li><a href="/MM/MMRealNumbers.htm#decimalrepresentationoftherealnumbers">Decimal represen&shy;tation of real numbers</a></li>

<li><a href="MMSetNotation.htm#problem">Problems with setbuilder notation.</a></li>

</ul>


<p class=smallind>Notation is both something you
visualize in your head and also a <i>physical</i> represen&shy;tation of the object. 
In fact notation can also be thought of as a mathe&shy;matical object in itself;
this point of view is worked out in detail in <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic">mathe&shy;matical logic</a> and in <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science">theoretical computing science</a>.   If you
think about what notation “<i>really is</i>” a lot,  you can easily get a headache…</p>

<h4>Symbols</h4>

<ul>

<li>When I think of the square root of $2$, I visualize the  <b>symbol</b> “$\sqrt{2}$”. That is both a typographical object and a mathe&shy;matically defined <b>symbolic represen&shy;tation</b> of the square root of $2$.</li>

<li>Another symbolic represen&shy;tation of the square root of $2$ is "$2^{1/2}$".  I personally don't visualize that when I think of the square root of $2$, but there is <i>nothing wrong with visualizing it that way.</i></li>

<li>What is <b><font color="#8000FF">dangerous</font></b> is thinking that the square root of $2$ <b><i>is</i></b> the symbol “$\sqrt{2}$” (or "$2^{1/2}$" for that matter). The square root of $2$ is an abstract <a href="/MM/MMMathObj.htm">mathe&shy;matical object</a> given by a precise <a href="/MM/MMDefs.htm">mathe&shy;matical definition</a>. </li>

<li>One precise definition of the square root of $2$ is "the positive real number $x$ for which $x^2=2$".
</li>
</ul>

<a name="integers"></a>

<h4>Integers</h4>
<ul>

<li>If I mention the number "two thousand, six hundred forty six" you may visualize it as "$2646$".  That is its <a href="/MM/MMRepsModels.htm">decimal represen&shy;tation.</a> </li> 


<li>But $2646$ also has a <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_factorization">prime factorization</a>, namely $2\times3^3\times7^2$.</li>

<li>It is wrong to think of this number as <i>being</i> the notation "$2646$".  Some notations are useful in one way and others are useful in another way. </li>

<li>For example, the prime factorization of $2646$ tells you immediately that it is divisible by $49$.

<li>On the other hand, the decimal representation "$2646$" tells you immediately that it is bigger than two thousand.</li>

</li>
<li>See <a href="/MM/MMRepsModels.htm">Represen&shy;tations and Models.</a></li>
</ul>


  <p class='smallind' >When I was in high school in the 1950's, I was taught that it was incorrect to say "two thousand, six hundred <b><i>and</i></b> forty six".  Being naturally rebellious I used that extra "and" in the early 1960's in dictating some number in a telegraph mes&shy;sage.  The Western Union operator corrected me.  Of course, the "and" added to the cost.  (In case you are wondering, I was in the middle of a postal Diplomacy game in <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game)#Postal_play_and_postal_hobby">Graustark</a>.)
</p>

<a name="formula">
<h4>Formulas</h4>

<ul>
<li>You can think of the <a href="#archalmost">arch function</a> as its  <b>formula</b> $25-{{(t-5)}^{2}}.$    The formula tells you that its graph will be a parabola (if you know that quadratics give parabolas) and it tells you instantly without calculus that its maximum will be at $t=5$.</li>

<a name="anotherformula">
<li>Another
formula for the same function is $-{{t}^{2}}+10t$.   The formula is <i>only another represen&shy;tation </i> of the function.  It is <i>not the same thing</i> as the function. 
The functions   $h  (  t  )$ and   $k  (  t  )$ defined on by $h(t)=25-{{(t-5)}^{2}}$
and $k(t)=-{{t}^{2}}+10t$ are <i>the same function;</i> in other words,   $h   =   k$. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Set notation</h4>

<p>You can think of the set containing $1$, $3$ and $5$ and nothing else as represented by its common <a
href="MMSetNotation.htm#listnotation">list notation</a> $\{1, 3, 5\}$.  But remember that $\{5, 1,3\}$ is another notation for the <i>same set</i>. In other words the list notation has <i>irrelevant features</i> – the order in which the elements are listed in this case.</p>


<p><img
width=139 height=311 src="Mathematica/JPEG/MetImages/MetImages parabola.jpg" align=right></p>

<a name=kinetic></a>
<h3>Kinetic</h3>


<h4>Shoot a ball straight up</h4>
<ul>

<li>The <a href="#archalmost">arch function</a>  could model the height over time of a physical object, perhaps a ball shot vertically upwards on a planet with no atmosphere. </li>

<li>The ball starts upward at time $t=0$ at elevation $0$, reaches an elevation of (for example) $16$ units at time $t=2$, and lands at $t=10$.</li>

<li>The parabola is <i>not</i> the path of the ball.  The ball goes up and down along the $x$-axis. A point on the parabola shows it locaion on the $x$ axis at time $t$.</li>

<li>When you think about this event, you may imagine  a <i><b>physical event</b> continuing
over time</i>, not just as a picture but as <i>a feeling of going up and down.</i></li>

<li>This feeling of the ball going up and down is created in your mind presumably using <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neurons">mirror neuron</a>.  It is connected in your mind by a <i>physical connection</i> to
the understanding of the function that has been created as connections among some of your neurons. </li>

<li>Although $h(t)$ models the height of the
ball, <i>it is not the same thing as the height of the ball.  </i> A mathe&shy;matical
object may have a relationship in our mind to physical processes or situations
but it is distinct from them.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Remarks</h4> 
<ol>
<li>This example 
involves a picture (graph of a function). Kinetic
understanding can also help with learning math that does not involve pictures. 
For example, when I think of evaluating the function ${{x}^{2}}+1$ at $3$, I visualize
$3$ as moving into the <i>x </i>slot and then the formula $9^2+1$ transforming
itself into $10$. (Not all mathematicians visualize it this way.)</li>

<li>I make the point of emphasizing the physical existence  <i>in your brain</i> of kinetic feelings (and all other metaphors and images) to make it clear that this whole section on images and metaphors is about objects that have a physical existence; they are not abstract ideals in some imaginary ideal space not in our world. See <a href="/Word%20Press/?p=9046">Thinking about thought.</a>

</li>

</ol>

<a name="process"></a>
<h3>Process  </h3>
 
<p>It is common to think of a function as a <b>process</b>: you put in a number (or other object) and the process produces another number or other object. There are examples in <a href="/MM/MMImagesMetaphorsFunctions.htm#process">Images and metaphors for functions.</a></p>

<a name="longdivision"></a>

<h4>Long division</h4>

<p>Let's divide $66$ by $7$ using long division.  The process consists of writing down the decimal places one by one.</p>  

<ol>
<li>You guess at or count on your fingers to find the largest integer $n$ for which $7n\lt66$. That integer is $9$.</li>

<li>Write down $9.$ ($9$ followed by a decimal point).</li>

<li>$66-9\times7=3$, so find the largest integer $n$ for which $7n\lt3\times10$, which is $4$.</li>
 
<li>Adjoin $4$ to your answer, getting $9.4$</li>

<li>$3\times10-7\times4=2$, so find the largest integer $n$ for which $7n\lt2\times10$, which is $2$.</li> 

<li>Adjoin $2$ to your answer, getting $9.42$.</li>

<li>$2\times10-7\times2=6$, so find the largest integer for which $7n\lt6\times10$, which is $8$.</li>

<li>Adjoin $8$ to your answer, getting $9.428$.</li>

<li>$6\times10-7\times8=4$, so find the largest integer for which $7n\lt4\times10$, which is $5$.</li>

<li>Adjoin $5$ to your answer, getting $9.4285$.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can continue with the procedure to get as many decimal places as you wish of $\frac{66}{7}$. </p>

<h5>Remark</h5>

<p>The sequence of actions just listed is quite difficult to follow. What is difficult is not understanding what they say to do, but where did they get the numbers?  So do this exercise!</p>

<font color="#800080"><h5>Exercise worth doing:</h5>

<p><b>Check that the procedure above is exactly what you do to divide $66$ by $7$ by the usual method taught in grammar school:</b></p>
</font>

<center>
<img width=120 height=200 src="Mathematica/JPEG/MetImages/LongDiv.jpg">
</center>
<!-- 9.4285714285714285714 -->

<h5>Remarks</h5>
<ul>
<li>The long division process produces as many decimal places as you have stamina for.   It is likely for most readers that when you do long division by hand <i>you have done it so much that you know what to do next without having to consult a list of instructions.</i> </li>

<li>It is a <b>process</b> or <b>procedure</b> but not what you might want to call a function. The process <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_definition">recursively</a> constructs the successive integers occurring in the decimal expansion of $\frac{66}{7}$.</li>



<li>When you carry out the grammar school procedure above, you know at each step what to do next. That is why is it a <b>process</b>. But do you have the procedure in your head all at once?</li>

<li>Well, instructions (5) through (10) could be written in a programming language as a <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_loop">while loop</a>, grouping the instructions in pairs of commands ((5) and (6), (7) and (8), and so on). However many times you go through the while loop determines the number of decimal places you get. </li>

<li>It can also be described as a formally defined recursive function $F$ for which $F(n)$ is the $n$th digit in the answer.
</li>

<li><font color="#800080"><b>Each of the program and the recursive definition mentioned in the last two bullets are
exercises worth doing.</b></font> </li>

<li>Each of the answers to the exercises is then a <a href="/MM/MMMathObj.htm">mathematical object</a>, and that brings us to the next type of metaphor...</li>

</ul>
</div> 

<a name="object"></a>

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>A particular kind of metaphor or image for a mathematical concept is that of a <b>mathematical object that represents the concept</b>.</p>
<h4> Examples</h4>
<ul>

<li>The number $10$ is a <a href="/MM/MMMathObj.htm">mathematical object</a>.  The expression "$3^2+1$" is also a mathematical object.  It <a href="//wrap.warwick.ac.uk/471/1/WRAP_Tall_dot2000a-objec-encap-jmb.pdf">encapsulates</a> the process of squaring $3$ and adding $1$, and so its value is $10$.</li>

<li>The <a href="#longdivision">long division process</a> above finds the successive decimal places of a fraction of integers. A program that carries out the algorithm encapsulates the process of long division as an algorithm.  The result is a mathematical object.</li>

<li>The expression "$1958$" is a mathematical object, namely the decimal represen&shy;tation of the number $1958$.   The expression 
"$7A6$" is the hexadecimal represen&shy;tation of $1958$. <i> Both represen&shy;tations are mathematical objects with precise definitions.</i>
</li>

</ul>

<p>Represen&shy;tations as math objects is discussed primarily in <a href="/MM/MMRepsModels.htm">Represen&shy;tations and Models</a>. The difference between represen&shy;tations as math objects and other kinds of mental represen&shy;tations (images and metaphors) is primarily that a math object has a precise <a href="/MM/MMDefs.htm">mathematical definition.</a>  Even so, they are also mental represen&shy;tations.</p>

<a name="usesmen">

<h2>Uses of mental represen&shy;tations</h2>

<p>Mental represen&shy;tations of a concept make up what is arguably the most important part of the mathe&shy;matician's understanding of the concept.</p>
<ul>
<li> Mental
represen&shy;tations of mathe&shy;matical objects using metaphors and images are <b>necessary
for understanding and communicating about them</b>   (especially with types of objects
that are <a href="#newold">new to us</a>) .</b> </p>

<li>They are <b>necessary for seeing how
the theory can be applied.</b></p>

<li>
  They are <b>useful for coming up with proofs. </b>(See <a
href="#informalproof">example below</a>.)  </p>
</ul>


<h3><a name=manyrepresen&shy;tations>Many represen&shy;tations</a></h3>

<p> Different mental represen&shy;tations of the same kind of object
help you <b>understand different aspects</b> of the object.  </p>

<center><table border="0"><tr><td>
<p class='purpleprose'>
Every important mathe&shy;matical object<br /> has many different kinds of represen&shy;tations<br /> and mathe&shy;maticians typically keep<br /> more that one of them in mind at once.
</p></td></tr></table></center>





<p>But images and metaphors are also <b>dangerous (</b><a
href="#dangerous">see below</a>).</p>

<h3><a name=newold> New concepts and old ones</h3>

<p>We
especially depend on metaphors and images to understand a math concept that is  new
to us  .  But
if we work with it for awhile, finding lots of <a
href="MMUsefulAdd.htm#examples">examples</a>, and
eventually proving theorems and providing counterexamples to conjectures, we
begin to  understand the concept in its own terms   and the images and metaphors tend
to  fade away from our awareness.</p>

<p>Then,
when someone asks us about this concept that we are now experts with, we
trundle out our old images and metaphors – and are often surprised at how
difficult and misleading our listener finds them!</p>

<p>Some
mathe&shy;maticians retreat from images and metaphors because of this and refuse to
do more than state the <a href="MMDefs.htm">definition</a>
and some theorems about the concept. They are wrong
to do this. That behavior encourages the attitude of many people that </p>

<li><i>Mathe&shy;maticians can’t explain things.</i></li>

<li><i>Math concepts are incomprehensible or bizarre.</i></li>

<li><i>You have to have a mathe&shy;matical mind to understand math.</i></li>
</ul>


<p>
<b>All three of these statements are half-truths.</b></p>

<p class='smallind' >
In my opinion the third statement is only about 10 percent true.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that a lot of
abstract math is hard to understand, but understanding is certainly made easier
with the use of images and metaphors. 
</p>

<h3>Images and metaphors on this
website</h3>

<p>This website has many examples of useful mental
represen&shy;tations.  Usually, when a chapter discusses a particular type of
mathe&shy;matical object, say rational numbers, there will be a subhead entitled "Images
and metaphors for rational numbers".    This will suggest ways of thinking about them that
many have found useful. </p>

<h2> Two levels of images and metaphors</h2>

<p>Images and metaphors have to be used at <b>two
different levels</b>, depending on your purpose.  </p>
<ul>
<li>You should expect to use <b><a
href="#richview">rich view</a></b> for understanding, applications, and coming up with proofs.</li>

<li>You
must limit yourself to the <b><a href="#rigorousview">rigorous view</a></b>
when constructing and checking proofs. </li>
</ul>


<p>Math teachers and texts typically do not make an
explicit distinction between these views,   and you have to learn about it by  osmosis. In practice, teachers and texts <i>do</i> make the distinction
<i>implicitly</i>.  They will say things
like, “You can think about this theorem as …” and later
saying, “Now we give a rigorous proof of the theorem.” 
Abstractmath.org makes this distinction explicit in many places throughout the
site.</p>

<h3>The
<a name=richview>rich view</a></h3>

<p>The kind of metaphors and images discussed in the <a href=
#mentalrepresen&shy;tations>mental represen&shy;tations</a> section above make math rich, colorful and intriguing   to think about.  This is the   <b>rich view   of math</b>.  The
rich view is vitally important.   </p>

<ul><li>
  It is what makes math  <b>useful
and interesting.</b></li>

<li>
  It helps us to  <b>understand</b>
the math   we are working with.</li>

<li>
  It suggests  <b>applications</b>.</li>

<li>  It suggests  <b>approaches
to proofs.</b></li>
</ul>


<h5><a name=informalproof>Example</a></h5>

<p>You expect the ball whose trajectory is modeled by the
function <i>h(t) </i><a href="#pictureofgraph">above</a> <i> </i>to <b>slow
down as it rises</b>, so the derivative of <i>h</i> must be smaller at <i>t
= 4 </i> than it is at <i>t = 2.</i>  A mathe&shy;matician might even say that that
is an “informal proof” that $h'(4)&lt;h'(2)$.  A rigorous proof is given <a
href="#forp">below</a>.</p>

<h3><a
name=rigorousview>The rigorous view</a>: <a name=inun>inertness</a></h3>

<p>When we are constructing a <a
href="MMDefs.htm">definition</a> or <a
href="MMProofs.htm">proof</a> we cannot
trust all those wonderful images and metaphors. 

<ul>
<li>Definitions must
not use metaphors. </li>

<li>Proofs must use only <a
href="MMMathReasoning.htm">logical reasoning</a> based on <b>definitions</b> and
<b>previously proved theorems.</b></li> 
 </ul>



<p>For the point of view of doing proofs, math
objects must be thought of as <a name=inert><b>inert</b></a> (or <b>static</b>),
like your <b>pet rock.</b> This means they</p>
<ul>
<li><b>don’t move or change over time,</b> and </li>

<li><b>don't interact with other objects,</b> even other mathe&shy;matical objects.</li>
</ul>

<p>(See also <a
href="MMMathObj.htm#abstractobject">abstract object</a>).</p>

<ul>

<li>When
mathe&shy;maticians say things like, “Now we give a rigorous proof…”,  part of what they mean is that they have to <i>forget about all the color
and excitement of the rich view and think of math objects as totally</i> <b>inert.</b>   Like, <font color="#800080"><b>put the object under an anesthetic
when you are proving something about it.</b></font></li>

<li>As I wrote previously, when you are trying to understand  <a
href="#archalmost">arch function</a> $h(t)=25-{{(t-5)}^{2}}$, it helps to think of it as representing a ball thrown directly upward, or as a graph describing the height of the ball at time $t$ which bends over like an arch at the time when the ball stops going upward and begins to fall down.</li>

<li>When you <i>proving</i> something about it,  you must be in the frame of mind that says <i>the function (or the graph) is all laid out in front of you, unmoving.</i> That is what the rigorous mode requires.  Note that the rigorous mode is a <i>way of thinking</i>, not a claim about what the arch function "really is".</li>

<li>When in rigorous mode,  a mathe&shy;matician will
think of $h$ as a <i>complete mathe&shy;matical object all at once,
</i> not changing over time. The
function is the <i>total relationship</i> of the input values of the input parameter
$t$ to the output values $h(t)$.  It consists of
a <i>bunch of interrelated information</i>, but
it <i>doesn’t do anything</i> and it <i>doesn’t
change</i>.</li>

</ul>

<a name=forp></a>

<h4><a href="#informalproof"><b> Formal</b></a><b>  proof </b>that $h'(4)&lt;h'(2)$</h4>

<p><a
href="#informalproof">Above</a>, I gave an informal argument for this.   The rigorous way to see that $h'(4)\lt h'(2)$
for the arch function is to
calculate the derivative \[h'(t)=10-2t\]
and plug in 4 and 2 to get \[h'(4)=10-8=2\]
which is less than $h'(2)=10-4=6$.</p>
<p class='smallind' >
Note the <a
href="MMMoreLanguage.htm#embedding">embedded
phrases</a>.</p>
<p>This argument picks out particular data about the function that
prove the statement.  It says nothing about anything slowing down as $t$
increases. <b> It says nothing about anything at all changing.</b></p>

<h4>Other examples</h4>
<ul>
<li>    The
rigorous way to say that “Integers go to infinity in both directions” is
something like this:  “For every integer <i>n</i> there is an integer <i>k</i>
such that <i>k &lt; n </i> and an integer <i>m</i> such that <i>n &lt; m.”</i></li>

<li>     The
rigorous way to say that continuous functions don’t have gaps in their graph is
to use the $\varepsilon-\delta $ <a
href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function">definition of
continuity.</a></li>

<li>    <a
href="MMConditional.htm">Conditional assertions</a>
are one important aspect of mathe&shy;matical reasoning in which this concept of unchanging
inertness clears up a lot of misunderstanding.   “If… then…” in our intuition
contains an idea of causation and of one thing happening before another (see
also <a href="MMConditional.htm#note1">here</a>). 
But if objects are inert they don’t cause anything and if they are unchanging
then “when” is meaningless.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rigorous view does not apply to all abstract objects,
but only to mathe&shy;matical objects.  See <a
href="MMMathObj.htm#abstractobject">abstract
objects</a> for examples.</p>

<h2>Metaphors
and images are dangerous</h2>
<p class='smallind' >
The price of metaphor is eternal vigilance.--<i><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Weiner">Norbert Wiener</a></i>
</p><p class='smallind' >
An analogy can be help&shy;ful, but it isn’t the same thing as the same thing.  <i>– The Economist</i></p>

<p class="headed">Every
mental represen&shy;tation has <b>flaws.</b>  Each one
provides a way of thinking about an $A$ as a kind of $B$ <i>in some respects</i>.
But the represen&shy;tation can have <b>irrelevant
features</b>.  People new to the subject
will be tempted to think about $A$ as a kind of $B$ in <i>inappropriate</i>
respects as well.  This is a form of <a
href="MMCognitiveDissonance.htm">cognitive
dissonance</a>. The metaphors inherent in representations can also <i>contradict each other.</i> That is also a form of cognitive dissonance.</p> 

<p> It may be that <i>most</i> difficulties
students have with abstract math are based on <i>not knowing which aspects
of a given represen&shy;tation are applicable in a given situation.</i>  Indeed,
on not being consciously aware that <i>in general you must restrict the applicability
of the mental pictures that come with a represen&shy;tation. </i></p>

<p>In <a href="">abstractmath.org</a> you will sometimes see this statement: <b> “What
is wrong with this metaphor:”</b>    (or <b>image</b>, or <b>represen&shy;tation</b>)
to warn you about the flaws of that particular represen&shy;tation.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>The graph of the arch function $h(t)$
makes it look like the two arms going downward become so <i>nearly vertical</i> that
the curve has vertical <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptote">asymptotes</a>. 
But <i>it does not have asymptotes</i>.  The arms going down are <i>underneath
every point of the $x$-axis.</i>   For example, there is a point on the curve underneath the
point $(999,0)$, namely $(999, -988011)$.</p>

<p>That graph is a picture that sits on your screen without moving. It gives a static picture of the set of points \[(t,25-{{(t-5)}^{2}})\]
The function $h(t)$ can also be thought of as the path of a rocket, which is <i>moving</i>. So the two points of view contradict each other, which I think makes it hard for some students to "see" the movement when looking at the graph.</p>  

<h4>Example</h4>
<p> A set is sometimes described as a <b>container.</b> But consider:  the
integer 3 is "in" the set of all odd integers, and it is also "in" the set $\left\{
1,\,2,\,3 \right\}$.  How could something be in two containers at once?  (More
about this <a href="MMSetMetaphorImage.htm#container">Images and Metaphors for Sets</a> and in <a href="/MM/MMSetSpecific.htm#metaphorsimagesemptyset">Some Specific Sets.</a>)</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>Mathe&shy;maticians think of the real numbers as constituting a
line infinitely long in both directions, with each number as a point on the
line. <i>But this does not mean that you can think of the line as a row of
points.</i> See <a href="MMRealDensity.htm#density">density of the real line</a>.
</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>We commonly think of functions as machines that turn one
number into another.  But this does not mean that, given any such function, we
can construct a machine (or a program) that can calculate it.  For many functions,
it is not only <i>impractical</i> to do<i>, it is theoretically
impossible to do it.</i> They are not <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_function_theory#Turing_computability">computable</a>.
In other words, <i>the machine picture of a
function does not apply to all functions.</i></p>

<h2>Final remarks</h2>


<h3>Mental represen&shy;tations are physical represen&shy;tations</h3>

<p class='smallind' >
The language that nature speaks is mathe&shy;matics.  The language that ordinary human beings speak is metaphor. <i><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson">Freeman Dyson</a></i>
</p>

<p>It seems likely that <a
href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive">cognitive</a> phenomena such as images
and metaphors are physically represented in the brain as collec&shy;tions of neurons
connected in specific ways.  Research on this topic is pro&shy;ceeding rapidly. 
Perhaps someday we will learn things about how we think physi&shy;cally that actually
help us learn things about math.</p>

<p>In any case, thinking about mathe&shy;matical objects as
physi&shy;cally represented in your brain (not neces&shy;sarily completely or correctly!)
wipes out a lot of the dualistic talk about ideas and physical objects as
separate kinds of things.  Ideas, in partic&shy;ular math objects, are <a
href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence">emergent</a> constructs in the
physical brain.  </p>

<h3> About metaphors</a></h3>

<p> “Metaphor” is used in
abstractmath.org to describe a <i>type of thought configuration</i>.
 It is an <i>implicit conceptual identification
of part of one type of situation with part of another.  </i></p>

<p> Metaphors
are  a <i>fundamental way we understand the world.</i>  In particular, they are a <i>fundamental
way we understand math.</i></p>

<h4><b> The word “metaphor”</b></h4>

<p> The word “metaphor” is also used
in rhetoric as the name of a <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor">type
of figure of speech. </a> Authors often refer to metaphor in the meaning of 
thought configuration as a <b>conceptual metaphor.  </b>Other figures of
speech, such as <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simile">simile </a>and <a
href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synecdoche">synecdoche</a>, correspond to
conceptual metaphors as well.</p>
