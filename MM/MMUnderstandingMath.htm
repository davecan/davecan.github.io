<h1>UNDERSTANDING MATH</h1>

<p class=smallind><i>In mathematics you don’t understand things, you just get used to them.</i>  –John von Neumann</p>

<p class=blue>This
page is intended to raise your consciousness about the many ways there are to
understand “understand” in math. A link to each chapter about
understanding math is given here with some comments about the ideas expressed
in it.</p>

<h2><a href="MMDefs.htm">Definitions</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>One
piece of information you must have about a math concept is its <b>definition</b>.
</li>


<li>Every
proof of a fact about the concept must be based on a <strong>logical chain of
reasoning starting with the definition.</strong>  </li>

<li>The
definition is one path to understanding the concept <i>but not the only
one</i>.  </li>

</ul>

<h2><a href="MMMathObj.htm">Math objects</a></h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Mathematical
objects</b> are what mathematics is “about”.</li>


<li>The
number $42$ is a math object.  </li>

<li>The set of even positive integers is a
math object.  Even though it is an infinite set, it is a <i>single math object.</i></li>

<li>The function $f(x):={{\sin }}x$ is a
math object.  Its value can be computed at many different numbers but it is a <i>single,
static math object.</i> You can visualize going along it from left to right, which makes you go up and down over and over between $1$ and $-1$, and it is useful to visualize it that way (see <a href="MMImagesMetaphors.htm">Images and Metaphors</a>), but it is a <i>single,
static math object.</i> </li>


<li>We talk
and think about math objects in some of the same ways that we talk about
physical objects, but in other ways they are <i>not like physical objects</i>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="MMMathStructure.htm">Math
Structures</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>A <b>mathematical structure</b> is a special kind of math
object defined as a set with some associated objects called structure. 
Equivalence relations, partitions, groups and topological spaces are examples of
mathematical structures.</p>

<h2><a
href="MMRepsModels.htm">Representations and models</a></h2>


<p>“Representation”
and “model” have <strong>several related meanings</strong>.</p>
<ul>

<li>We can <b>represent</b>
the number $42$ in binary notation as $101010$ and in hex as $2A$.  </li>


<li>We can <b>represent
</b>a function by its formula or by its graph, or sometimes by a listing of its
values.</li>


<li>When we
think about some math objects we may have a <strong>mental representation</strong>
of them (like whooshing up and down on the graph of the sine function).  </li>


<li>We can <b>model
</b>the trajectory of a ball by a function.</li>


<li>A group
is a <b>model</b of the group axioms.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a
href="MMImagesMetaphors.htm">Images and metaphors</a></h2>

<ul>
<img width=166
height=242 src="Mathematica/Understanding Math/image002.png" align=right hspace=12>
<li>We think of a function that has a positive derivative as “going up”.  But the
function <i>isn’t really going up</i>, it just sits there like your
pet rock.</li>


<li>We think of the parabola $y={{x}^{2}}$ as like a bowl whose sides go up
forever.  But “forever” is a metaphor.  <i>There is no time involved.</i> 
</li>


<li>Besides,
we may forget that <i>the sides of the parabola go out in the positive and negative x­
direction “forever”,</i> too (every vertical line cuts
the graph!), even though the picture looks like they are too steep to do that. 
</li>

</ul>

<p>As these examples illustrate, we think
about math objects in terms <strong>of images and metaphors</strong> that we
have developed out of our experience with them.  These are valuable insights
but they generally <i>cannot be used to prove theorems about them</i>.</p>


<p>There <i>is</i> a way of thinking about any math object that helps when you are trying to prove something: the <a
href="MMImagesMetaphors.htm#rigorousview">rigorous view</a> of math objects,
also discussed in this chapter.</p>

<h2><a
href="MMConceptualComputational.htm">Conceptual and Computational</a></h2>


<p>When mathematicians consider a <span class=MsoHyperlink><b><a
href="MMMathObj.htm">math object</a></b></span> they are typically interested
in <i>two different aspects</i> of the object:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>What is
it?</b> What properties does it have?  How is it different from
other math objects?  I want a <i>conceptual understanding</i> of the object.</li>

<li><b>How do
I compute with it?</b>  How do I find a value of the object (if that makes
sense)?  How to I tell how big it is (in some sense of big)?  How do I determine in an efficient way what properties it
has?</li>

</ul>

<p>Proofs
can have a conceptual side and a computational side too.</p>
 
<ul>

<li>A <b>conceptual proof</b> helps you understand why the statement is true.  </li>


<li>A
<b>computational proof</b > may be easier to check systematically to see if it is
correct, and to automate using some suitable computer program.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class=blue><a href="MMOtherAspectsUnderstanding.htm">Other aspects of understanding math</a></h2>
