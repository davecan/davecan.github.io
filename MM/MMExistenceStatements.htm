<h1>EXISTENCE STATEMENTS </h1>

<p class=blue>An <a
name=existencestatement><font color="#911B1B">existence statement</font></a>
is a claim that there is a value of a certain variable that makes a certain assertion true.</p>

<h5>Examples</h5>

<ol>

<li><b>There is</b> an integer $n$ that is bigger than $2$. The variable is $n$ and it varies over integers. The assertion is "$n$ is bigger than $2$." The statement is true.</li>

<li><b>There is</b> a right triangle $T$ with sides $1$, $2$ and $3$. The variable is $T$ and it varies over triangles. The assertion is false by the Pythagorean Theorem.</li>

<li><b>There is</b> a real number $x$ for which ${{x}^{2}}+x=1$. True. On the other hand, the statement "There is a real number $x$ for which ${{x}^{2}}+x=-1$" is false. (Proof: find the minimum of $x^2+x+1$.)</li>


</ol>

<h3>The existential quantifier symbol</h3>

<p>For an assertion $P$, a statement of the form "$\exists xP(x)$" means that there is at least one
<a href="MMMathObj.htm">mathematical object</a> $c$ of the type
of $x$ for which the assertion $P(c)$ is true. The symbol "$\exists$" is pronounced
"there exist(s)" and is called the <b>existential
quantifier</b>.  It is also discussed in the section on <a href="MMOtherSymbols.htm">symbols</a>.</p>

<a name="witness"></a>

<h5>Example</h5>

<p>For the assertion (1) above, $P$ is the statement "$n\gt2$" and the statement "$P(42)$", in other words "$42\gt2$", is true, so "$\exists n(n\gt2)$" is true.</p>
 
<h4>Witnesses</h4>

<p>In the example just given, $42$ is said to be a <b>witness</b> that "$\exists n(n\gt2)$" is true. Note that $3$ is another witness but $1$ is not a witness.</p><p class=smallind>The fact that "$1\gt2$" is false does not mean that "$\exists n(n\gt2)$" is false, it only means that $1$ is not a witness to its being true.</p>

<h3>How existential statements are
worded.</h3>

<p>Let $n$ be
of type integer and suppose $P(n)$ is the assertion "$n$ is
divisible by $6$". Then the statement "$\exists nP(n)$" can be expressed
in Mathematical English in these ways: </p>

<ul>

<li><b>There is</b> (or "There exists") an integer $n$ that is divisible by $6$.</li>

<li><b>For some</b> integer $n$, $n$ is divisible by $6$.</li>

</ul>

<p>You can also use statements that don't give the integer $n$ a name, such as:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>There is</b> (or "There exists")
an integer divisible by $6$.</li>

<li><b>There are</b> integers divisible by $6$.</li>

<li><b>Some</b> integers are divisible by $6$.</li>

</ul>


<h3>Warning: Cognitive Dissonance is immanent</h3>

<p>If the assertion $\exists
xP(x)$ is true, there may be only <i>one</i> object $c$ for which
$P(c)$ is true, there may be <i>many</i> values of  $x$ for which $P(x)$
is true, and in fact $P(x)$ may be true for <i>every</i> $x$
of the appropriate type.</p>

<p class=purpleprose>These
interpretations are different<br />from ordinary English usage<br />and can cause <font color="#911B1B">cognitive dissonance.</font></a></p>

<p>In particular, in
mathematical discourse:</P> 

<ul>

<li>The statement "Some
primes are less than $3$" is <i>true</i>, even though there is exactly
one prime less than $3$. The fact that "primes" is plural in the statement may lead you to say the statement is false, causing <a href="MMCognitiveDissonance.htm">cognitive dissonance</a>. In math, it is a true statement.</li>

<li>The statement "Some primes are integers" is
true, even though <i>all</i> primes are integers. In everyday English, you simply wouldn't say "<i>some</i> primes are integers" since <i>all</i> of them are. </li>
</ul>

<p class=purpleprose>Some phrases in Math English<br />don't have the same meaning as in ordinary English.</p>

<p>The
<a href="/Handbook/handbook.pdf">Handbook</a> (under
<b>existential quantifier</b>) has more discussion about this and references.</p>
