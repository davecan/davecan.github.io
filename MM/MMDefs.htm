<h2>Definitions in math and in other subjects</h2>


<p class=smallind>"<i>When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean--neither more nor less.</i>" -- Humpty Dumpty</p>

<p class=blue>A mathematical definition is fundamentally different in two ways from other kinds of defi&shy;nitions, a fact that is not widely appre&shy;ciated by students or even by mathe&shy;maticians. The differences cause students much trouble.</p>

<a name="AA"></a>

<h4>AA:. A mathematical definition is a list of properties</h4>

<ul>

<li><div class=boxed><p class=noind><span class=purple>The definition of a math object is given by <font color="#911B1B">accumulation of attributes</font>, that is, by listing properties that the object is required to have.</p></span></li></div>

<li>Dictionary and scientific definitions may name some properties of the object they are defining, but the properties are not always definitive.</li>

<li>Dictionary and scientific definitions may also give <b>typical examples</b> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_theory">prototypes</a> of the object. See <a href="#typical">Typical examples</a> and <a href="#lakoff">Lakoff</a>. </li>

</ul>

<a name="DE"></a>

<h4>DE: A mathematical definition is imposed by decree</h4>

<ul>

<li>Most commonly, we learn the meanings of words and phrases by their <b>verbal and social context</b>. This is sometimes called learning by <b>osmosis</b>.</li>

<li>The definition of a word in a dictionary is <b>extracted</b>: it is determined by <b>studying the way the word is used</b> in writing and in speech.</li>

<li><div class=boxed><p class=noind><span class=purple>The definition of a math word is <font color="#911B1B">stipulated</font>: it is <font color="#911B1B">imposed on the reader by decree.</font></p></span></li></div>

</ul>

<p class=headed>This chapter starts by summarizing the properties of mathematical definitions; the rest of the chapter goes into more detail.</p> 

<p>See also the <a href="#handbook">Handbook of mathematical discourse</a> and the <a href="#edwardsward">papers by Edwards and Ward</a>.</p>

<a name="summary"></a>

<h2>Properties of a math definition</h2>

<p class="blue">The four rules below are <font color="#911B1B">absolute requirements</font> that all mathematical definitions obey:</p>

<ul class=blue><a name="LP"></a>
    <li class=blue>LP: The definition consists of a list of <font color="#911B1B">some of the properties</font> of the concept (and nothing else).</li>

<a name="EAP"></a>
    <li class="blue">EAP: Any example of the concept must <font color="#911B1B">have all the properties</font> listed in the definition (not just most of them).</li>
<a name="OAP"></a>
<li class="blue">OAP: Every math object that <font color="#911B1B">has all the properties</font> listed in the definition is an example of the concept. </li>

<a name="COMP"></a>

<li class="blue">COMP: Every correct statement about the concept <font color="#911B1B">follows logically from its definition.</font></li>
</ul>

<p class="bluesmall">Math definitions have other properties as well. The list below describes aspects of definitions that people new to abstract math don't always understand:</p>

<ul class=bluesmall>
<a name="FP"></a>

<li>FP: The definition gives <font color="#911B1B">a few
properties</font> that are enough to determine the concept.</li>

<a name="ME"></a>

<li>ME: <font color="#911B1B">Much else may be known</font> about the concept besides what is in the definition.</li>

<a name="NI"></a>

<li>NI: The info in the definition
<font color="#911B1B">may not be the most important things</font> to know about the concept.  </li>

<a name="DL"></a>

<li>DL: The same concept can have <font color="#911B1B">very
different-looking definitions.</font>  In some cases, it is difficult to prove they give the same concept.</li>

<a name="SW"></a>

<li>SW: Math
texts use <font color="#911B1B">special wording</font> to give definitions.  Newcomers
may not understand that the <a
href="MMIntent.htm">intent</a> of an assertion is
that it is a definition.</li>

<a name="CW"></a>

<li>CW: The word or phrase being defined may involve a word that already exists, but <font color="#911B1B">the connotations of that word are worthless when you are proving something about the concept that the definition defines.</font></li>

</ul>

<a name="examplesofdefinitions"></a>

<h2>Examples of definitions</h2>

<p>A <b>mathematical definition</b> prescribes the meaning of a
word or phrase in a very specific way.  The word or phrase is defined in terms of a list of required properties</i></b> (<a href="#LP"><b>LP</b></a>), although the list may be
disguised by the wording.  </p>

<p> </i></b>In this website, the word or phrase  being defined is
called the <a name=definiendum><b>definiendum</b></a>. The phrase that
gives the definition is called the <a name=defphrase><b>defining phrase.</b></a> (A special case is the <a
href="MMFuncSpec.htm#formula">defining formula</a>
of a function.)

<p>The definiendum can refer to either of these:</p>
<ul>
<li> A <b>noun</b>, which names a type
of <a href="MMMathObj.htm">math object.</a></li>

<li> An <b>adjective</b>, which names a
property that a math object can have.</li></ul>


<h3>Nonsense example</h3>

<p>Here is a nonsense
example. It uses words that (supposedly) have no meaning, to emphasize that when you see a mathematical definition <i>the form of the definition gives information even though it may use words you don't know.</i></p>

<h4>Definition</h4>

<p class=bluesmall>A <a name=quilgo><font color="#911B1B">quilgo</font></a><b> </b>is a torca that is
wabic and frumious.</p>

<p>The definiendum is "quilgo" and the defining phrase is: "is a torca that is wabic and
frumious".  The word "quilgo" is a noun that names the type of object. The list of required properties of a quilgo are: (1) It must be a
torca. (2) It must be wabic.  (3) It must be frumious.</p>

<p>We could have decided to use an adjective, say "quilgic", for our definition. Then the definition would be: "A torca is <b>quilgic</b> if it is wabic and frumious."</p>


<h4>What the definition tells you</h4>
<ul>
<li> If
you have a quilgo then it is a torca <i>and</i> it is wabious <i>and</i> it is frumious <b>(<a href="#EAP">EAP</a>).</b></li>
<li> If
you have a torca which is wabic and frumious then it <i>must be</i> a quilgo <b>(<a href="#OAP">OAP</a>).</b>  (You could reword this, since "wabic" and "frumious" are adjectives: <i>A wabic, frumious torca is a quilgo</i>.)

</li>
<li>If
you have a torca which is wabic but not frumious then it is not a quilgo.  It
is <i>not "almost a quilgo" or anything of the sort</i>. It is simply not a quilgo.</li>

<li>If
you have an object which is wabic and frumious but it is not a torca then it is
<b><i>NOT</i></b> a quilgo:</i> (Mathematical definitions are <a href="#crisp">crisp</a>.)</p>
</ul>


<a name="bydefinition"></a>

<h4>"By definition": a magic formula</h4>
<p><b>In a
proof, you can use any of the facts in the definition with this phrase: <font color="#911B1B">"by
definition"</font>.</b></p>
<ul>
<li> If T is
a quilgo, then you can say "T is wabious by definition."  </li>

<li> If T is
a wabious, frumious torca then you can say "T is a quilgo by definition". </li>

<li> If T is
a torca that is not frumious then you can say "By definition of quilgo, T is
not a quilgo." </li>
</ul>

<h3>Example: positive</h3>


<h4>Definition</h4><p class=bluesmall>For any integer $n$, $n$ is <font color="#911B1B">positive</font> if $n &gt; 0$.</p>

<ul>

<li>We know $-(-3)=3$ and $3>0$, so <i>by definition of "positive"</i>, $-(-3)$ is positive. That is an example of proving something by directly using a definition.</li>

<li>When you get further along in math, you usually wind up quoting previously proved theorems to construct a proof.</li>

<li>The fact that $-(-3)$ has a minus sign in front of it is irrelevant. The proof depends on the fact
that "$3$" and "$-(-3)$" are <i>two different names for the same object.</i></li>

</ul>

<a name="primedef"></a>
<h3>Example: prime number</h3>

<h4>Definition</h4>

<p class=bluesmall>An integer $n$ is <font color="#911B1B">prime</font> if 

<ul>

<li>$n>1$, and </li>

<li>the only positive divisors of $n$ are $1$ and $n$.</li>

</ul>

<p>Some who have just learned this may say, "Then $1$ is a prime because the only positive divisor of $1$ is $1$!" But <font color="#8000A0"><b>a definition a dictator:</b></font> this definition says $n$ must be greater than $1$, so it follows from <a href="#EAP">EAP</a> that $1$ is not a prime, never mind that it fits the other part of the definition.</p>

<p>Yes, the definition is a dictator, but still it is perfectly reasonable to ask, "<i>Why</i> does the definition of "prime" exclude $1$ from being a prime?" It is because including it would make it more complicated to state the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic">fundamental theorem of arithmetic</a>.</p>


<p>The definition of a math object is defined by mathematicians and they can define it in any way they want (<a href="#DE">DE</a>), so naturally they make a definition that is useful, and they can change it any time they want. (That happened with primes; for a while in the nineteenth century $1$ <i>was</i> a prime.)</p>

<p class=purpleprose>Mathematicians make definitions to suit their convenience</p>

<a name="squareroot"></a>

<h3>Example: square root</h3>

<h4>Definition</h4>
<p class=bluesmall>The
symbol $\sqrt{2}$ denotes the unique positive real number whose square is $2$.   </p>

<p><i>Everything that is true about $\sqrt{2}$ follows from this
definition</i> (<a href="#COMP">COMP</a>). That includes the fact that the decimal expansion
of $\sqrt{2}$ begins $1.414\ldots$ and <span class=purple>that may have been what you really wanted to know</span> <a href="#NI">(NI)</a>. (More about this <a href="#sqrtmore">below).</a>

<tr>
<td><p class='purpleprose'>The facts about an object that are given by its definition<br />
may not be the ones most important to you
</p></td></tr></table></center>

<a name="domain"></a>

<h3>Example: domain</h3>

<h4>Definition</h4>

<p class=bluesmall>A <font color="#911B1B">domain</font>
is a connected open set. 

<ul>

<li>"Domain" also has other meanings: See the <a
href="MMGlossary.htm#domain">Glossary entry</a>.</li> 

<li>The <a href="#definiendum">definiendum</a> is
"domain".</li>

<li>The list of properties: "is a set", "connected" and
"open".</li>

</ul>

<p>You may not be familiar with words such as "connected" and
"open", but in this chapter I am writing about the <i>form of the wording</i> of the definition and what that form tells you about the meaning. So the definition can be translated as saying that 
a set is a domain if it is connected and open, whatever "connected" and "open" mean!</p>

<p>The <a href="#appendix">appendix</a> provides an intuitive example that may help you think about "connected" and "open".</p>


<a name="howdefinitionsareworded"></a>
<a name=defworded>

<h2>How definitions are worded</a></h2>

<p>There are many different ways to word a definition, and this
long section describes a great many of them.  You may think that only a
grammarian or a dictionary editor would appreciate such infinite attention to
detail, but <i>I recommend that you glance through the possibilities
listed</i>. You may discover</p>
<ul>
<li> Some wordings that you <i>may not recognize as definitions</i>. </li>

<li>A phrase that may <i>lead you to believe that it is a definition</i> when it is not. (Difficulties like these are also discussed in <a href="MMIntent.htm#unmarkeddefinitions">Intent of Assertions</a>.)</li>

<li> Other wordings that <i>may mislead you as to what is being required</i>.</li>
</ul>
<a name="defcond"></a>

<h3>Definitions using conditionals</h3>

<p>It is common to word definitions using "<a href="MMGlossary.htm#if">if</a>", in a <a href="MMConditional.htm">conditional
assertion</a>. The conditional assertion,
like any such, may be worded with hypothesis first or with conclusion first.
Part of the hypothesis may be stated first in a separate sentence, called the <a
name=precondition><b>precondition</b></a> of the definition.  (See more about
preconditions <a
href="MMMoreLanguage.htm#precondition">here.</a>) 
All this is illustrated in the list of examples following, which you may think is long enough. Even so, the list is not exhaustive.
</p>

<h4>Domain</h4>
<ul>
<li> A set
is a <b>domain</b> if it is open and connected. </li>

<li> If a
set is open and connected, it is a <b>domain</b>.</li>

<li> A set $D$ is a <b>domain</b> if $D$ is open and connected.  (Or "…if it is open and connected".)</li>

<li> The set $D$ is a <b>domain</b> if $D$ is open and connected. (This form with "the" occurs mostly in older texts. I have known students to think it meant they were supposed to <i>already know</i> what $D$ is.)</li>

<li> Let $D$
be a set [this is a precondition]. Then $D$ is a <b>domain</b> if
it is open and connected. </li>

<li> Let $D$ be a set. Define $D$ to be a <b>domain</b> if it is open and
connected.</li></ul>

<h4>Even</h4>
<p>The definition of "even" can be done
in most of these ways as well:</p>
<ul>
<li> An
integer is <b>even</b> if it is divisible by $2$.</li>

<li> An
integer $n$ is <b>even</b> if $n$ is divisible by  $2$. </li>

<li> The
integer $n$ is <b>even</b> if $n$ is divisible by  $2$.  </li>

<li> Let $n$ be an integer. Then $n$ is <b>even</b> if it is divisible by  $2$. </li>

<li> Let $n$ be an integer. Define $n$ to be <b>even</b> if it is divisible
by  $2$. </li>

<li> If $n$
is an integer, then it is <b>even</b> if it is divisible by  $2$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes a constraint is put on the variable in the
definition <i>after</i> the definition is stated, commonly in parentheses.
For example: "$n$ is <b>even</b> if it is divisible by $2$ ($n\in \mathbb{Z}$)". 
This is called a <a
href="MMMoreLanguage.htm#postcondition">postcondition.</a> See also <a href="MMGlossary.htm#where">where</a>.</p>

<p>There is more about "if" <a href="#moreif">below</a>.</p>

<a name="markdef"></a>


<h3>Marking the definiendum</h3>

<ul><li> All the
definitions above are given with the <a href="#definiendum">definiendum</a>
marked by being in <b>boldface</b>.  That is standard practice on this website.</li>

<li> <i>Italics
</i>is often used instead to mark the definiendum.  In the past, italics have been more common in books than boldface for definitions.</li>

<li> You may
be able to tell that a statement is a definition <i>only</i> because
a word or phrase is in italics or boldface, as in "An integer is <b>even</b> [or <i>even</i>] if it is divisible by $2$."</li></ul>

<center><table border="0">
<tr>
<td><p class='purpleprose'>
A statement in
which one phrase<br /> is in italics or boldface <br />
is probably a
definition of that phrase
</td></tr></table></center>
<ul>

<li> Some
authors do not mark the definiendum at all, but include it in a paragraph
marked "definition", for example: "Definition: An integer is even if it is divisible by $2$."</li>

<li> Another
way of marking the definiendum is to use a phrase such as "<a name=saidtobe><b>said
to be</b></a>":  "An integer is <b>said to be</b> even if it is divisible by
2."   </li>

<li> Sometimes
<i>no indication at all</i> is given that the statement is a
definition.   This is an <i>evil thing to do</i>, but it does happen.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Commandments</h4>
<p>Sometimes the author <a name=defascommand><b><i>commands</i></b></a><b><i>
you to
define something</i></b>, for example:  

<ul>

<li>"<b>Define</b> an integer to be even
if it is divisible by 2" </li>

<li>"<b><a
href="MMGlossary.htm#call">Call</a></b> an integer even if  it is divisible by 2"
</li>

 <li>"<b>Say</b> an
integer is even if it is divisible by 2" </li>

</ul><p><i>This is not in fact telling you to do something, it is just telling you what it
means for an integer to be even. </i></p>
<a name="defsymexp"></a>

<h3>Defining symbolic expressions</h3>

<p><a href="MMSymLang.htm">Symbolic
expressions</a> may be defined using the same terminology and styles as in definitions
of words and phrases.  </p>

<p>When defining a word or phrase the <a
href="MMVarMeanings.htm#scope">scope</a> of the
definition is usually the entire document (the definition will stay in effect
to the end).  Occasionally the author will say something like, "Just for the
rest of this proof, say that a number is <b>frumious</b> if…"  </p>

<p>However, symbolic expressions are commonly defined for quite
narrow scopes, a paragraph or a section.  Besides the ways I have already mentioned
there are many other ways to say it the case of narrow scope:</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>
<ul>
<li> <b><a
href="MMGlossary.htm#Let">Let</a></b> $f(x)={{x}^{2}}+1$.</li>

<li> <b>Say</b> [or
<b>suppose, assume, put</b>] $f(x)={{x}^{2}}+1$. ("Put" is not as common as the others.)</li>

<li><b> Define</b> $f(x)$
to be ${{x}^{2}}+1$. (As I said above,
this is not a command.)</li>

<li> $f(x):={{x}^{2}}+1$.   This symbol "$:=$" is called <a name=colonequals></a><a
href="MMOtherSymbols.htm#colonequals">colon
equals</a> and originated in computer science.  Some mathematicians now
routinely use it at the blackboard.</li>
</ul>

<a name="moreif"></a>
<h3>More about "if"</h3>

<p>The standard definition of <b>even</b> says:</p>

 

<p><b>Definition:</b> If an integer is divisible by $2$, then it is <b>even</b>.</p>

<p>You can then use the definition to prove a theorem:</p>

<p><b>Theorem:</b> If an integer is divisible by $4$, then it is even.</p>


<p class=smallind>Note that this wording means that the theorem is true for <i>any</i> integer. See <a href="MMGlossary.htm#A">indefinite article</a>.</p>

<p><b>Proof:</b> If $n$ is divisible by $4$. then by the definition of "divides", there is an integer $k$ for which $n=4k$. But $4k=2(2k)$, and $2k$ is an integer, so $n$ is $2$ times an integer. So by definition of "divides", $n$ is even.</p>

<p>Because of the <i>definition,</i> it is correct to
say <i>both of these things:</i></p>
<ul>
<li> If an
integer is divisible by $2$ then it is even.</li>

<li> If an
integer is even then it is divisible by $2$.</li>
</ul>

<p>But the <i>theorem only justifies this
one statement:</i></p>
<ul>
<li>If an
integer is divisible by $4$ then it is even</li>
</ul>

<p>The theorem does not justify saying</p>

<ul>
<li>
If an integer is even then it is divisible by $4$.
<i>In
fact, that statement is false.</i>
</li>
</ul>

<center><table border="0">
<tr>
<td><p class='purpleprose'>
The word "if"<br />
 goes both ways inside a definition   <br />
 goes only one way inside a theorem<br />
</p></td></tr></table></center>

<p>Because of this, some authors have begun using "if and
only if" in definitions instead of "if", as in:"<b>Definition:</b>
An integer is <b>even</b> if and only if it is divisible by $2$."
More about this in the <a
href="MMGlossary.htm#if">Glossary entry</a> for "if".</p>

<h2>Properties of
mathematical definitions</a></h2>

<h3>Every proof originates solely in the definition</h3>

<center><table border="0">
<tr>
<td><p class='purpleprose'>
The definition
of a math concept<br />is the
fundamental fact about the concept<br />from which all
other facts about it must be deduced
</p></td></tr></table></center>

<a name="alltruth"></a>

<p>The special logical status of a definition (every true statement about the concept follows from the definition) is the reason that <a
href="MMUsefulBehaviors.htm#rewritebydefinition">rewriting
according to the definitions</a> is a <b><i>reasonable first step in coming
up with a proof.</i></b>
<p>Here are some seemingly contradictory points about the <a href="MMIntro.htm#purpleprose">purple prose</a> above:</p>

<h4 class=redit>You generally have to use other theorems to prove a statement about the concept</h4>

<p>The proof of any except the most elementary theorem about a concept will use other theorems about the concept. For example, perhaps the definition of the concept implies Theorem A and Theorem A implies Theorem B. Since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_conditional">implication is transitive</a>, this means that the definition implies Theorem B.</p>

 
<a name="sourceofunderstanding"></a>

<h4 class=redit>The definition is not the only source of understanding the concept</h4>

<p>
Many facts about a concept can help in giving you an intuition about it, because the info that is in
the definition <i>may not include the most important aspects of the concept.</i> This is about <i>understanding</i> and is separate from the fact that the theorems can be <i>used</i> in the proof, as mentioned in the preceding point.</p>

<h5 class=red>Example</h5>

<p>Suppose you run across a line in a math text that says, "Because $\sqrt{2}\lt1.5$...". The definition of $\sqrt{2}$ does not give its value, but the fact that it is approximately  "$1.414$" tells you it is less that $1.5$. (See the discussion of square root <a href="#squareroot">here</a>).</p>


 <p class=headed>Metaphors and intuition that you have about the concept are also vital in <i>coming up with</i> a proof, although you cannot <i>use them</i> in the proof. See 
<a href="#images">Images and Metaphors</a> below.</p>

<a name="subsetliterally"></a>

<h4 class=redit>The definition must be taken literally.  </h4>

<p>The notation and terminology used may suggest properties
the definition does not actually require.
</p>

<h4>Example: Subset</h4>

<p>The standard definition of "<a href="MMSetSubset.htm#subset">subset of a set</a>" allows the whole set to be a subset of itself, but the "sub" prefix in ordinary English may make you think a subset has to be a <i>part</i> of the set but not the whole thing. The point is that <span class=purple>your feelings about the meaning of "subset" are irrelevant</span>. All that matters is the definition. See <a
href="MMCognitiveDissonance.htm#semanticcontamination">semantic
contamination</a>.</p>

<h4 class=redit>The same concept can have very <a name=differentdefs>different-looking
definitions</a></i></b>. </h4>

<p>The definitions may have nothing at all in common with each other, and it may not be easy to prove
they give the same concept.</p>

<h4>Example: Two definitions of $\sqrt{2}$</h4>

<p>You can define $\sqrt{2}$ as the unique positive real number $r$ for which $r^2=2$, or by saying $\sqrt{2}=\frac{1}{\sin (\pi/4)}$. The second definition is totally lame, but it is in fact a correct definition and could be used to estimate the decimal places of $\sqrt{2}$ by drawing the appropriate right triangle, measuring the sine, and dividing the result into $1$.</p>

<h4>Example: Equivalence relations and partitions</h4>

<p>A much more important example of two different-looking definitions is given in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation#Fundamental_theorem_of_equivalence_relations">equivalence relations and partitions</a> in Wikipedia. The usual definition of equivalence relation (a reflexive, symmetric and transitive relation) and a partition (a set of subsets of a set such that every element of a set is contained in exactly one of them) determine <i>exactly the same structure on the set,</i> even though the definitions look utterly different.
</p>

<p class=smallind>The point of this equivalence of definitions is that an equivalence relation determined a unique partition, and a partition determines a unique equivalence relation, and (take a deep breath) <i>a partition determines an equivalence that always determines the partition you started with, and an equivalence relation determines a partition that always determines the equivalence relation you started with.</i> It is worth working out a couple of small finite examples to understand this!</p>

<ul>

<li> There
are some very basic words with two common <a href="#eqdef">inequivalent</a> definitions, and <i>math texts don't always tell you which definition they are using.</i>
Examples: 
<ul>
<li>The <a
href="MMNaturalNumbers.htm">natural numbers</a> may or may not contain zero, and both these definitions occur
commonly. </li>

<li>A <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_%28mathematics%29">ring</a> may or may
not be required to have a multiplicative identity.</li>
</ul> </li>


<a
name="positive"></a>
<li> There
are many, many words and phrases that have one definition that most texts use, but for which some texts give other definitions. For example, "positive" means "greater than zero" in almost all texts, except for certain
European educational systems (perhaps only France), where it means "greater than or equal to $0$".</li>

<li>Certain words and symbols have more than one meaning, and sometimes both those meanings are used in the same document.</li>

<ul>

<li>The word "domain" can mean a <a href="#domain">connected open subset</a> of a topological space, the set on which a function is defined, or several other things, spelled out in the <a href="MMGlossary.htm#domain">glossary</a>.</li>

<li>The notation "$(a,b)$" may denote an ordered pair, an open interval of real numbers, or the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$. This is discussed in more detail in <a href="MMDelimiters.htm#notationab">Delimiters</a>.</li>




</ul>

<li> Certain
words and phrases have a standard meaning in one branch of mathematics and a
<i>different</i> standard meaning in another branch.</li>
<ul>
<li><b>Field</b>  means completely different things
in abstract algebra and in mathematical physics.</li>

<li><a href="MMGlossary.htm#graph"><b>Graph</b></a> means two different things in college calculus and in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph theory</a>.</li>

</ul>

<li> Some
math objects have two different standard symbols in different subjects (for
example the number called "$i$" in math is called "$j$" in electrical engineering).</li>

<li> Some
symbols such as <a

<a href="MMGlossary.htm#logarithm">log</a> have
just one meaning in high school but are used with several different meanings in
post calculus math.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Standardization is hopeless</h3>

<p>When we gain a new understanding of a type of math object,
we often realize that the names we have chosen don’t work well and need to
change them.  Because of this common phenomenon, there are authors who deliberately
set out to reform the terminology in a subject and redefine many of the terms
in the subject or substitute others.
<font color="#8000A0"><b><i>Such attempts rarely work.</i></b></font></p> 

<p class=smallind><a

<h2>Images
and metaphors for definitions</h2>

<p class=bluesmall>Images and metaphors associated
with the concept of definition, and the motivation behind the
concept, contribute greatly to understanding definitions, but <i>images and metaphors
cannot (directly) be used in proofs.</i></p>

<a name="justenough"></a><a name="minimal"></a>

<h3>Metaphor: Definition as "just enough"</a></h3>

<p>In order to make it easy to show that some object is an
example of the concept, the definition is <i>minimal</i> (or nearly
so).  It includes <i>just enough information</i> to determine the concept, but not much more.</p>


<p class=smallind>Definitions are not always <i>absolutely</i> as small as they can be. For example, the usual defi&shy;nition of <b>group</b> given in under&shy;graduate abstract algebra requires more than it needs to. See <a href="http://bluehairedanne.com/archives/associativity-left-identity-left-inverse-element-makes-a-group">Sooji Shin's expla&shy;nation</a> of one minimal defi&shy;nition of group.</p>


<p>The minimality of a mathematical definition hides
the richness and complexity of the concept and as such may not be of much use if
you want to understand it. The definition can also give you an exaggerated idea
of the importance of the items that the definition <i>does</i> include,
particularly in the case of the many devious definitions
in math discussed <a href="#devious">below</a>.</p>

<p>For example, a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)">group</a> is defined as
a set with a binary operation satisfying certain properties.  But groups are important primarily because their elements are <b>symmetries.</b> The definition of group says
nothing about the elements being symmetries, although it follows from the definition that the
elements of any group are symmetries of in general several different structures.</p>

<p class=purpleprose>When you think about a kind of math object<br />think about everything you know about that sort of object<br />not just what the definition says.</p>

<h3><a name=alltruth>Metaphor: The definition is source of all truth about the concept</a></h3>


<p>
I need to clarify what "source of all truth" means. (It is another way of saying <a href="#COMP">COMP</a>.)</p>

<p>One definition of "triangle"
is that a triangle consists of three points connected by line segments. This definition more precisely determines <i>every statement that is true about every triangle</i>. For example, it follows from the definition of triangle (using the rules of plane geometry) that the angles at the corners of a triangle always add up to $\pi$. It <i>doesn't</i> follow from the definition that every triangle is isosceles.
</p>

<p class=smallind>Note that I am ignoring fine points such as degenerate triangles.</p>

<a name="sqrtmore"></a>
<h4>The square root of two</h4>

<p>Suppose you want to know the length $d$ of the diagonal
of a square whose sides have length 1.  You apply the Pythagorean Theorem and conclude
that $d=\sqrt{2}$.  </p>

<p>Now at this point I will make the (unrealistic) assumption
that <i>you know the basics of algebra but nothing at all about square
roots and you don’t have a calculator.</i>  You look up the definition of the
radical sign:</p>

<blockquote><b><font color="#800040">Definition:</font></b> $\sqrt{r}$ is the unique positive real number <i>s</i>
such that ${{s}^{2}}=r.$</blockquote>

<p>So ${{d}^{2}}=2.$  Well <i>big
whoop.</i>  You want to know <i>how long</i> the diagonal is.  That definition
says nothing about length. 
This is an example of the
"just enough" nature of definitions.  The thing you are most interested in is approximately how
long the diagonal is, and the definition of $\sqrt{2}$ says
nothing about that. </p>

<p>However,
you can get an estimate of how big $\sqrt{2}$ is by using
simple algebra facts, including the one that says: for positive $x$ and $y$, if ${{x}^{2}}\lt {{y}^{2}}$ then $x\lt y$. Now you start calculating: </p>

<ul>
 <li>${{1}^{2}}=1$
and ${{2}^{2}}=4$, so $1\lt \sqrt{2}\lt 2.$</li>

<li>Hmm, ${{(1.5)}^{2}}=2.25$, so $1\lt \sqrt{2}\lt 1.5$.</li>

<li>Well, ${{(1.4)}^{2}}=1.96$ so $1.4\lt \sqrt{2}\lt 1.5$.</li>

<li>$(1.45)^2=2.1025$, so $1.4<\sqrt{2}<1.45$.</li>

<li>$(1.41)^2=1.9881$, so $1.41<\sqrt{2}<1.45$.</li>

<li>$(1.42)^2=2.0164$, so $1.41<\sqrt{2}<1.42$</li>


</ul>

<p>By doing this over and over you can get many decimal places of $\sqrt{2}$. This shows that  <i>information about the magnitude of $\sqrt{2}$ is implied by the definition.</i></p>

<a name="devious"></a>


<h3>Metaphor: Definitions may be <font color="#008000">devious</font>...  </h3>

<p class=blue>Some apparently simple math concepts have really off-the-wall definitions.
</p>
<p>In some situations, a <a href="#specifications">specification</a> may be a useful substitute for a difficult definition.</p>
<ul>
<li> The
most widely accepted definition of <a
href="MMSets.htm">sets</a> uses the <b><i>Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms</i></b> (<a
href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Zermelo-FraenkelAxioms.html">MW</a>, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo-Fraenkel_axiom">Wi</a>). There are
<b><i>nine</i></b> of them!   (Ten if you include the <b>Axiom of Choice</b> (<a
href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AxiomofChoice.html">MW</a>, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice">Wi</a>)).  This complexity
came about because of <a
href="MMRussellsParadox.htm">Russell’s
Paradox.</a> I am reasonably certain that no more than about twenty percent of professional mathematicians could quote all the Zermelo-Frankel axioms.</li>

<li> The <a
href="MMNaturalNumbers.htm">natural numbers</a>
are defined by the <b>Peano Axioms</b> (<a
href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PeanosAxioms.html">MW</a>, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms">Wi</a>). They are not as
complicated as the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms but they are based on <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_induction">proof
by induction</a>. Using the ZF axioms, even the simplest facts about the natural
numbers must be proved by induction.</li>

<li> The <a
href="MMRealNumbers.htm">real numbers</a> may be
defined by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_cut">Dedekind cuts</a>,
which are difficult to understand and cumbersome to deal with. There are <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_numbers">several other ways</a> to
define the reals, also complicated.</li>

<li> Both <a
href="MMFuncSpec.htm">functions</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation">relations</a>
are defined in terms of <i>sets of ordered pairs</i>, which is not
difficult or complicated but is <i>hardly what you have in mind when you are
thinking about functions and relations! </i></p>

<p class=smallind>This definition using sets of ordered pairs  is in both
cases a ploy for <i>allowing functions or relations to be completely
<a href="MMGlossary.htm#arbitrary">arbitrary</a></i>. For example, "$=$" and "$\lt$" and "divides" (as in "$4$ divides $96$") are all relations, but so is the completely arbitrary relation that says "$2$ is related to $3$ and $3$ is related to both $2$ and $5$ and that's all". This is definitely a relation, although useless, and is represented as the set $\{(2,3),(3,2),(3,5)\}$.</li>
</ul>



<a name="crisp"></a><a name="fuzzy"></a>
<h3>Metaphors: Crisp and fuzzy</h3>

<p>In many situations outside math, definitions are <a
name=fuzzy></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_set"><b>fuzzy</b></a><b>. 
</b>For example, "warm weather" is a fuzzy concept.  Perhaps everyone will
agree that if the temperature is 30 degrees C. then we have warm weather, and
if it is 10 degrees C. we do not have warm weather. But 20 degrees is sort of
borderline. Some will say it is warm and some will not. (I say it is not. But then, I grew up in Savannah.) </p>

<p class=purpleprose>Mathematical concepts are <b>crisp</b>. Either something fits the definition of a mathematical concept or it does not.</p>

<a name="typical"></a>
<a name="prototype"></a>

<h3>Metaphors: Typical, trivial and monstrous.</h3>

<h4>Typical</h4>

<p>There is a sense in which a <b><i>robin is a typical bird</i></b> and a <b><i>penguin is not a typical bird</i></b>. The Wiktionary definition of "bird" says they are "characterized by being warm-blooded, having feathers and wings usually capable of flight, and laying eggs." The word "usually" kills the possibility that that is a mathematical definition, but it allows us to say penguins are not typical birds. That is completely appropriate for definitions in biology, but does not work for math definitions.</p>

<p>A mathematical definition is simply a list of properties in the very strict sense of <a href="#LP">LP, EAP and OP</a>.  If an object has all
the properties, it is an example of the definition.  If it doesn’t, it is not
an example. So in some basic sense <b><i>no example is any more typical than any
other</i></b>. This is in the sense of <b>rigorous thinking</b> described in the chapter on <a
href="MMImagesMetaphors.htm#richrigorous">images
and metaphors.</a></p>

<h4>Now I contradict myself?</h4>

<p>In spite of what I said in the previous paragraph, mathematicians talk about <b>typical</b> examples, <b>trivial</b> examples, <b>monstrous</b> examples and so on all the time!</p>

<p><span class=purple>The point is that these attitudes are based on <font color="#911B1B">intuition</font>. Expressing an <font color="#911B1B">attitude</font> about an example does not mean that it <font color="#911B1B">fits the definition</font> "better" or "worse" than some other example.</span></p> 

<h5 class=red>Example: Continuous curves</h5>


<ul>


<li>The graph of $y=x^3-x$ is a <b>typical</b> continuous curve.</li>

<li>The graph of $y=0$ is a <b>trivial</b> continuous curve.</li>

<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve">space-filling curve</a> is a continuous curve that goes through every point in the unit square. When it was first discovered some mathematicians called it <b>monstrous</b> because it was so weird and unintuitive. But <span class=purple>it is no more or less a continuous curve than any other continuous curve</span>.</li>

</ul>

<h5 class=red>Example: Finite groups</h5>

<ul>

<li>A group containing only one element is a <b>trivial</b> group.</li>

<li>A dihedral group is a <b>typical</b> finite group with $8$ elements.</li>

<li>There is a particular group called the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_group">monster group</a>. It is the
largest finite sporadic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_group">simple group</a>, so it is hardly typical. It has about $8\times 10^{53}$ elements. (The number of stars in the universe may be around $10^{30}$.)</li>

<li>The monster group deserves its name! Nevertheless, the word "monster" does not have a <i>mathematical</i> definition. With respect to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)">definition of "group"</a> the monster group is just another group.</li>

</ul>

<p class=smallind>It may sound really peculiar to a non-mathematician when you say that the monster group is a <i>simple</i> group.</p>


<h4>Intuition and rigor</h4>

<p>If you want to learn math, listen carefully to what a mathematician says is <b>rigorously true</b>, and also listen carefully when they describe their <b>intuition</b> about some mathematical structure.</p>

<p class='purpleprose'>Rigor and intuition<br />are both vitally important<br />to understanding math.</p>

<a name="specifications"></a>

<h2>Specifications</h2>

<p>Because the definition of a math concept can be <a
href="#devious">devious</a>, it may be hard to see how you can use it in a
proof.  A <b>specification </b>of a mathematical concept is a set of statements
that are all true of the concept and that suffice for many common uses, but
which <b><i>do not characterize</i></b> the concept.   These are the main
points about specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything the specification says
about the concept is true of the concept and may be used in proofs. (<b><a href="#EAP">EAP</a></b> is true.)</li>

<li>You can’t use the specification to
prove that something is an example of the concept. (<b><a href="#OAP">OAP</a></b> is not necessarily true.)</li>

</ul>
<p>The name "specification" is my own but many texts use what
amounts to a specification for certain concepts without using the word
"specification". The meaning I use for specification is similar in spirit to the way computing scientists use the word. </p>
<a name="orderedpair"></a>
<h4>Example</h4>

<p>Specification of an <b>ordered pair:</b> For any <a href="/MM/MMMathObj.htm">math objects</a> $a$ and $b$, the <b>ordered pair</b> $(a,b)$ is a math object with these properties:</p>

<ul>

<li>Its <b>first coordinate</b> is $a$.</li>

<li>Its <b>second coordinate</b> is $b$.</li>

<li>It is <i>determined completely</i> by the fact that its first coordinate is $a$ and its second coordinate is $b$.</li>

</ul>


<p>It follows from the specification that</p> <p class=boxed>$(a,b)=(c,d)$ if and only if $a=c$ and $b=d$.</p> 

<p class=purple>This is all you need to know about ordered pairs.</p>


<h4>Other examples</h4>

<p>I give a specification for sets in the <a
href="MMSetSpec.htm">chapter on sets</a> and a
specification for functions in the <a
href="MMFuncSpec.htm">chapter on functions.</a> The
list of properties of real numbers given in the <a
href="MMRealNumbers.htm">chapter
on real numbers</a> amounts to a specification.</p>

<p>See <a
href="MMDysfunctional.htm#literalism">literalism.
</a> </p>

<a name="appendix"></a>

<h3>Appendix</h3>
 
<p>I am not going to define "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_space">connected</a>" and "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_set">open</a>" but I will give an example that suggests what they mean.</p>

<p>Let $S$ be the set of points inside (not on the boundary) the red circle and $T$ be the set of points inside (not on either boundary) either the red or the blue circle:</p> 

<div align="center"><img 
 src="Mathematica/Circles.png"></div>

<p>For one of these sets to be <b>connected</b> means that if you have two points in the set you can draw a path connecting them that is entirely inside the set. So $S$ is connected, but $T$ is not.</p>

<p>For one of these set to be <b>open</b> means that for any point in the set, there is a tiny circle that (1) contains the point and (2) is entirely inside the set. So $S$ and $T$ are both open. But if you let $\bar{S}$ be the set in the red circle <i>including the boundary</i>, then $\bar{S}$ is not open because there is no tiny circle containing a point on the boundary that is entirely inside the set.</p>

<p>Note that although what I have said about <i>this example</i> is correct, it is misleading; there are more complicated situations where you cannot depend on how I described "connect" and "open" to give the correct answer.</p>
