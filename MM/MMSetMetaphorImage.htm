<h1>SETS: METAPHORS AND IMAGES</h1>

<p class=blue>This section describes certain common
images and metaphors we have for sets – and their dangers.</p>

<h2>A set is a mathematical object</h2>

<h5>Example</h5>

<p>The set $A:=\{3,5,6,7,8\}$ is a <a
href="MMMathObj.htm">mathematical object</a>.  

<ul>

<li>$A$ is <i>one object</i>. It is not five different numbers.</li>

<li>Its defining property is that the numbers $3$, $5$, $6$, $7$ and $8$
are elements $A$ and <i>nothing else</i> is an element of $A$.</li><li>$A$ <i>is
not the same thing as its elements.</i>  It is true that the integer $5$, for
example, has a special relationship to $A$, namely it is one of
the elements of $A$, but the set $A$ is an object that is <i>separate</i> from its elements.</li>

</ul>

<h5>Example</h5>

<p>The set $\mathrm{R}$ of all real numbers is a single math
object with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncountable">unimaginably many</a>
elements.  You may think it impossibly hard to think of all the real numbers at once. But $\mathrm{R}$ is <i>just one math object.</i>  You don’t have to think about
all the real numbers at once to think about $\mathrm{R}$, any more than
you have to think about all the molecules of water in the Pacific Ocean at once
to think about the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p class=purpleprose>A set is
one mathematical object:<br />not many, not a bunch, but one object.</p>

<h2>A set is not its notation</h2>

<p>When you visualize the set $\{3,5,6,7,8\}$, the image you
have may be the <a href="MMSetNotation.htm#listnotation"><b>notation</b></a> “$\{3,5,6,7,8\}$”. It is not
<i>entirely</i> bad to visualize the notation when you think of this set, but remember
that the notation has an <a href="MMImagesMetaphors.htm#irrelevant"><i>irrelevant
feature</i></a>, namely
the order in which the elements are written.  The set $\{3,5,6,7,8\}$ is
the <i>same set</i> as the one denoted by $\{3,6,7,5,8\}$, but the notation $\{3,5,6,7,8\}$ is <i>not the same</i> as the notation $\{3,6,7,5,8\}$. So it is wrong to think that the notation <i>is</i> 
the set.</p>
<p>Similarly,
for real $x$, $\left\{ x|x\gt6 \right\}=\left\{ x|x\ge 6\text{ and }x\ne
6 \right\}$ even though the notation before the equals sign  is different from the notationa after it.</p>

<p class=purpleprose>The same set can
be described by many different notations.</p>

<a name="setisacontainer"></a><a name="container"></a>
<h2>A set is a container</h2>

<p>You can think of a set as a <b>container</b> that holds all its elements.   This metaphor is good in some ways and bad
in others.</p>

<ul>

<li><i>Good:</i> Just like a set, container is a single object, different from any of the things it
contains.  In fact, it is different from the whole bunch of things it contains.</li>

<li><i>Bad:</i> Consider the sets $A=\{3,5,6,7,8\}$ and $B$ the set of all odd integers. Then $3\in A$ and
$3\in B$ and in fact $3\in A\cap B$.  How can one thing be in three different
containers?</li>

<li><i>Bad:</i> Using the
sets $A$ and $B$ just defined, note that $6\in A$ and $A\in \left\{
A,B\mathrm{} \right\}$. ($\left\{
A,B\mathrm{} \right\}$ is the set whose only elements are the sets $A$ and $B$.) But $6\notin \left\{ A,B\mathrm{} \right\}$.  This behavior
is not at all the way we usually think of containers:  If you have a dime in a
coin purse and the coin purse is in your pocket, you would say that the dime is
in your pocket.</li>

</ul>

<a name="venndiagram"></a>
<h2>Venn Diagrams</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram">Venn Diagrams</a>
give a useful picture of relationships between a few sets portrayed as points inside a circle (or other closed curve). The circle is then a
<b>container</b> and the elements of the set are shown as points inside the circle.</p>

<h5>Example</h5>
<p class=center><img width=150 height=150 src="Mathematica/Sets/Venn1.png"></p>

<p>The circle in the Venn diagram above represents the set $\{3,5,6,7,8\}$ shown as a subset of the integers between $1$ and $9$ inclusive. The element $3$ is shown as above $5$ and $7$ is northeast of $5$, and both those facts are completely irrelevant!</p>

<p class=purpleprose>There is no good way to represent a finite set<br />that does not have irrelevant information<br /> such as the location of the elements.</p>

<a name="setisapointer"></a>

<h2>A set is a pointer</h2>

<p>I prefer to think of the set $A=\{3,5,6,7,8\}$ as
a mathematical object that has a special relationship with the numbers $3$, $5$,
$6$, $7$ and $8$ that it does not have with any other objects. My mental image is a
node called $A$ that has wires or arrows connecting that node to those
five numbers and to nothing else. Those numbers can be moved around in the
picture but that makes no difference – all that counts is the connections. (In
that sense this picture is a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph#Directed_graph">directed graph</a>.)</p>

<p class=center><img width=150 height=150 src="Mathematica/Sets/Ptr.png"></p>

<p>You may see a
similarity between this and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)">pointer</a>
in a computer language. Typically a pointer in those languages will point to the head
of a list and each entry in the list will point to another one. But the proper
image for a set is that the pointer points to each one of them without
preference – there is no ordering, implicit or otherwise. Another difference
is that for sets, unlike computer language pointers, two different sets cannot
point to exactly the same bunch of elements.</p>
