<h1>PROOFS</h1>



<p>This is the top page of the chapter on Proofs.</p> 
<p class=blue>Proofs cause problems to people new to abstract math: </p> 

<ul class=blue>

<li>To verify that a mathematical statement is correct, you must <span class="redsmall">prove it.</span> Evidence does not count in math.</li>  

<li>What is a proof?  Many newcomers to abstract math <span class="redsmall">don't know that they don't know what a proof is.</span></li>

<li>How can you tell if a proof is correct?  Proofs are based on mathematical logic, but they are usually presented in narrative prose and do not mention many of the rules that justify the reasoning.</li> 

<li>How do you create a proof?  Abstractmath.org does not go into this very much.  There are <a href="#refs">good books and articles</a> about creating proofs.</li> 

</ul>
<a name="natureofproofs"></a>
<h2>The nature of proofs</h2>
<p>A <b>proof</b> is an argument intended to persuade other mathematicians of the correctness of a statement.  A proof has two main aspects:  Its <b>logical structure,</b> and its <b>presentation</b> (the way it is written).</p>  

<h3>Logical structure</h3>

<p>A proof has a <b>precise logical structure:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>A proof is a series of statements that I will call <b>proof steps.</b></li>  
  
<li>Each proof step must follow by a <b>correct logical method of deduction</b> from </li>

<ul>
<li>previous proof steps, </li>
<li>definitions, or </li>
<li>theorems that have already been proved.</li>

</ul></ul>

<p>The logical methods of deduction are described briefly in <a href="/MM/MMMathReasoning.htm">Mathematical reasoning</a>. Some of the ways these methods are expressed in written proofs are described in <a href="/MM/MMFormsProof.htm">Forms of Proof.</a></p>
   
<h3>Presentation</h3>
<p>Most proofs at the college level or higher are written in <b>narrative form,</b> resembling an essay.  To read such proofs you must learn how to <i>extract the logical form of the proof from the narration.</i>  (This is called the <a href="/MM/MMMathReasoning.htm#translationproblem">translation problem.</a>) To do this, you must be familiar with the <span class="redsmall">conventions used to write narrative proofs</span> <i>and</i> with the <span class="redsmall">rules of logical deduction,</span> since most simpler deduction rules are <i>used without mentioning them.</i> The articles <a href="/MM/MMProofPresentation.htm">Presentation of Proofs</a> and <a href="/MM/MMFormsProof.htm">Forms of Proof</a> gives some examples of how narrative proofs work.</p>

<h2>The role of proofs in math</h2>
<p>At the beginning of this article, I wrote: <q>To verify that a mathematical statement is correct, you must <span class="redsmall">prove it.</span> Evidence does not count in math.</q> This section spells out in more detail what I mean. </p>

<p class=blue>The only way to verify that a claim about mathematics is correct is to prove it.  Numerical evidence or the fact that the claim is true in some physical situation is suggestive but is not a verification.</p>

<p class=smallind>See <a href="#evidencethatfoolsyou">Evidence that fools you</a> for some examples.</p>

<p class="blue">
Mathematical proofs are public documents  that can be challenged and defended using known principles.  Any step in the proof can be challenged and a defender of the proof must analyze the step in more detail to show that it is correct - or to discover that in fact the step is incorrect and the proof is wrong!</p>

<p>This description of proofs shows how <span class=redsmall>math is a part of science.</span></p> </p>  
<ul>

<li>Every claim in math can be <b>tested:</b> Is there a proof of the claim? </li> 

<li>The idea of proof is so precise that something that claims to be a proof can <span class=redsmall>be checked to see if it really is a proof.</span> </li>

</ul>

<p>So the proof plays a role that is in some ways analogous to the role of experiments in other sciences.  (This analogy should not be pushed to far, though.)</p> 
 
<p>It is an observable fact that when mathematicians argue about whether some proposition is correct, they may argue heatedly for awhile but <i>eventually the argument comes to an abrupt and total end:</i>  One party realizes that <i>they have made a mistake,</i> or both parties realize they had <i>different definitions</i> for one of the concepts they were arguing about.</p>  


<p>Arguments among specialists in (say) literature or history are not like that - such arguments <i>can</i> and <i>do</i> go on for the lifetime of the participants. </p>

<h3>Evidence that fools you</h3>

<ul>

<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perrin_number">Perrin function</a> $P:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ has the property that for the first $271,440$ integers, if $n$ divides $P(n)$, then $n$ is a prime. However, $271,441$ divides $P(271,441)$, but $P(271,441)=521^2$.</li>

<li>Let $\pi(n)$ be the number of primes less than $n$. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem">prime number theorem</a> (in one form) says that $\pi(n)$ is approximately \[\text{Li}(n):=\int_2^n\frac{dx}{\ln x}\] 
In fact, for every value of $n$ that we know of, $\pi(n)\lt\text{Li}(n)$, although <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewes'_number">it is known</a> that that there is a number $N\lt 10^{371}$ such that $\pi(n)\gt\text{Li}(n)$. The number of atoms in the universe is estimated to be $10^{82}$.</li>
